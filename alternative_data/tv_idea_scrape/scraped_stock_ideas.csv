We rose to the $217 area and then started to move back down. If you were following along today, you know that was most likely the a wave and start of b wave. It is possible that was all of iv but doubtful. I expect us to drop to around the $207-$209 area before popping back up for our C wave of iv. If this plays out according, I am going to buy some puts for our wave v of (3) down. If I get the chance, I may buy some calls for this c wave but it depends on my assignment.   I work tomorrow and most likely won't be able to update very much. I will do what I can. If you have questions, feel free to refer back to my previous posts linked in the bottom or ask them on here.

2023-10-24 19:35:35,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/SPY/QDLUYScb-Spy/,"Last post I went over the tech sectors mostly to show how they were rolling  over. Fast forward and they are still rolling over  but I think we get a 2-3% pop before we continue that slide.   Here's my reason   IXIC or Nasdaq composite  represents  the entire tech unlike NDX/QQQ which represents  only the top 100.   Late Friday  we flush within 40 points of trendline support  and Close right on top of daily 200ema.   When Monday comes if we open up above 12,900 I want to buy the dip in tech for an anticipated  2% pop in the coming week.   Vix daily chart   Closed outside weekly bollingerband   Closed out side daily bollingerbands  2 days in a row.   This type of overextension is not sustainable  on the vix. Hourly CCI is at levels where you could easily see 20% pullback   Also possible  rising wedge formed   Closed  at .5 or 50% retracement  on fib, which is 21.74  resistance   I'd like to see Vix stay below 22 to be bullish on equities   10yr/TNX   Finished  Thursday  with a hangman on the daily,  followed with more pullback on Friday.   We are about 6% extended from the 21ema. Usually  at between 5-7% extended the 10yr returns back to test the 21ema (White line)   Spy 30 Min chart  I wanted to break down The time frame to show you the price action and pattern that has formed   Remember,  anything that sells off really quick usually  forms a bullish falling wedge and if it rises fast it forms a bearish rising Wedge.   Here you can see the rising wedge formed  that i think will take us back to 428,-430.   There's so much resistance  in that  area that you have to pause on any higher targets until spy closes over 432 again.   1. Fib resistance   2. Price action resistance   3. 20sma and 21ema resistance   U see where I circled? That was a fake breakout when Powell  was speaking Thursday.   The green arrow is where we rejected at  on fridays rebound before flushing to 421.   I know I always go over  how over sold the money flow or MFI is on The ES and NQ but now it's also severely  oversold on SPY 3-4 hour money flow.   The last 3 times spy went this oversold on the 4hour money flow these moves followed within the next 2 trading sessions   March 15th 2023   Spy 384   March 16th - Spy 396   3% pop   Nov 3rd 2022   Spy 369   Nov 4th 2022   Spy 378   2%pop   Sept 27th 2022   Spy 361   Sept 28th 2022   Spy 372   3% pop.   So if I'm right we should start moving higher by Tuesday.   I'll  post my long term bear view  along with DOW, NYSE, XLV, QQQ and XLF   Tomorrow"

Looking at it, I could easily see how someone could say it is in an ending diagonal structure and demands another low. This is signified by the turquoise count and has a 50/50 chance. I could also say this move down is over and we open up green tomorrow. As of now the NQ and ES opened green but that isn't really saying much.   The chart has my target boxes per the usual. We should retrace for iv next, and since wave ii was shallow and short, iv should be deep and long if the theory of alternation is to remain intact. If we either open even or red, I will most likely buy some calls in mass. The contracts I have been looking at are the 03 Nov $230 or $235 strike. We shall see what the morning brings.

The rally was fueled by slower inflation and hype over artificial intelligence.   But more recently, the Federal Reserve's unwavering higher-for-longer rate stance and a deepening bond-market rout have had a sobering effect on equities sentiment, with the S&P 500 index halving its year-to-date gains.   Indeed stock valuations are looking increasingly stretched, raising the risk of a correction.   One such indicator in particular is flashing   RED   - the relative valuation of stocks versus the debt market.   SPX / ICE BofA Corporate Total Return Index   In August this year, the S&P 500   SPX   climbed to levels last seen during the peak of dot-com boom, relative to an index that tracks the US corporate bond market.   The gauge is still holding near those highs, despite the recent pullback in equities.   The metric last surged this high in the spring of 2000  and that was followed by a multi-year meltdown in stocks that saw the S&P 500 crash 50% between March 2000 and October 2002.   SPX 50% Decline During 2000-2002   Another indicator that shows the richness of stocks relative to debt is the so-called equity risk premium  or the extra return on shares over government debt, which is considered a safer form of investment. The metric has plunged this year lows unseen in decades, indicating elevated stock valuations.   ""Equity risk premium is near its worst ever level going back to 1927. In the 6 instances this has occurred, the markets saw a major correction & recession/depression - 1929, 1969, 99/00, 07, 18/19, present,"" research firm MacroEdge said in a   recent post on X   (ex-Twitter).   The so-called equity risk premium (earnings yield minus bond yield) recently fell to a new cycle low and remains well below historical averages. In other words, the stock market has become more expensive relative to the bond market despite the recent pullback.   Meanwhile the main graph (quarterly Div-adjusted chart for   TLT   20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) illustrates perhaps right there could the end for U.S. Govt Bond Market decline, with Double top as a further projected/ targeted upside price action.   Will all of that bring U.S. stock market to 50% decline like in early 2000s!?   Time will show!"

It then started to move sideways between July '23 and September '23, forming lower highs into the trendline.   The uptrend was finally broken in late September '23/early October '23.   Now, the price finds itself at the resistance level of the previous uptrend and at the downtrend line created by the lower highs observed between July '23 and September '23. Additionally, there is an engulfing candlestick pattern in this area. This serves as my cue to enter a short trade.   Entry: 29.37   Stoploss: 33.56, -14.27%   Target: 20.78, +29.25%, 2.05 RR ratio"

That was also at the bottom of the 14-month Channel Up pattern. With the 1D RSI breaking below the 30.00 oversold barrier on Friday, this is technically the best buy opportunity since the Channel's first Low on October 13 2022.   In fact the two fractals are identical with the 2022 one breaking above the dashed Lower Highs trend-line and hitting the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level.

I originally turned bullish on it a bit too early last week, but the chart has become clearer over the past week or so as it hasn't been able to gain any strength.   From here, I think we'll see a capitulation in price over the next week going into the lower support area (buy zone).   From there, I think we'll see a very strong upside move in September that pushes price all the way up to the upper resistance (sell zone).   If you're able to trade it perfectly, it would setup a potential return of somewhere between 2x-3x (hence why I think it's one of the best trades).   Let's see if it plays out."

The stock price has been consistently trading below the orange and blue moving averages, reaffirming the bearish sentiment.   More recently, there seems to be an attempt at a reversal as the stock begins to trade above the moving averages and shows a pattern of higher highs and higher lows.   Support & Resistance Levels:   Bearish Line at 312.90 USD: This line seems to act as a recent support, where the price has bounced from it before. If the stock breaches this level going downward, it might continue its bearish trend.   Bullish Line at 317.36 USD: This is a significant resistance level where the price has struggled to break above.   Target Price 1 at 307.69 USD: This is the next significant support level below the bearish line, where the price might aim if it continues the bearish movement.   Target Price 2 at 321.15 USD: This is the next resistance level above the bullish line. Breaking above this level could further solidify a bullish trend.   Volume:   The trading volume is shown at the bottom of the chart. Notably, there seems to be a spike in volume during the bullish movement, suggesting increased buying interest.   Potential Reversal:   As the stock price begins to trade above the moving averages and starts forming higher highs and higher lows, this could be indicative of a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. However, it's crucial to monitor if the stock can maintain its position above the moving averages and break above the resistance levels to confirm this.   Ichimoku Cloud:   The stock is currently trading below the shaded area, which is typically seen as a bearish sign. However, it is inching closer to the cloud, suggesting potential bullish momentum if it can break and maintain above it.   To summarize, while the stock has shown a bearish trend for the majority of the visible period, there are recent signs of potential bullish momentum."

I was expecting this drop on MARA to come fill the gap created before we had a MASSIVE move of almost 100%.   This retracement will give us an idea whether or not MARA is drilling its floor and preparing for reversal, or further down side to come.   Furthermore, we do have a trend pattern, however to me it is not exactly clear whether it is a wedge or an up trend, as I would not want to short after such a retracement.

2023-10-24 14:42:26,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/XLP/wKTcaIMZ-Introduction-to-Relative-Strength-Part-3/,"In parts one and two (linked) we discussed the construction and use of relative strength ratios (RS) in trading and analysis, common errors, and best practice. In part three we look at the consumer discretionary to consumer staples ratio and attempt to draw trading and economic insight from that analysis.   Any method used to analyze a single security price chart can be used to analyze ratios. I tend to use simple methods and I do not require the same precision in terms of retracements and support/resistance that I would use when analyzing or trading a single security.   Consumer Discretionary (XLY) / Consumer Staples (XLP):   I generally think about this ratio in two ways. The first, and for my purposes, the most important, it reflects the markets judgement around the strength of the economy. When the economy is improving, as it has over the last few months, the ratio should weaken (which it has done). This is because as discretionary income rises, confident consumers are more likely to spend on non-essentials or staples. When they are less confident, they spend less on non-essential discretionary and more on staples. It is important to remember that consumption is around 70% of GDP. For economic or macro analysis, I prefer to use monthly perspective charts.   I believe that the long outperformance of discretionary relative to staples is mostly due to the massive liquidity added to the system since the great financial crisis. The liquidity that has aided consumers and thus the economy in general. As liquidity normalizes and the economy slows, staples should begin to outperform discretionary.   The second is creating a tradable spread. Creating proportional spreads (see part two) between two sector ETF's, expressing trades that overweight or underweight specific sectors inside a portfolio, or creating pairs trades using names within the two sectors are all legitimate uses of ratios. When creating pairs trades inside a sector my preference is to use each sectors market largest capitalization names (market generals) as they are less vulnerable to idiosyncratic risk. I also prefer to pair names with similar businesses. For instance, I would not pair Walmart (staples) with Tesla (discretionarily) but would consider Walmart or Costco verses Amazon.   One final thought, profitable spread trades can be structured using either highly positive or negatively correlated pairs. What fails to work consistently are spreads with spurious correlation.   Chart 1 TOP: Monthly Consumer Discretionary (XLY) in ratio to Consumer Staples (XLP): Top Panel: Close line charts for both ETFs.   Since XLY on the left scale trades at over two times the price level of XLP (172 verses 72), XLP has been compressed in order to easily compare the paths of the two symbols. Clearly both staples and discretionary have significant positive long-term correlation as they follow the larger market higher and lower. The high degree of correlation suggests that the two markets can be generally expected to trend together, but at varying rates depending on the consumer/economic outlook.  It is the difference in the rates of change that creates the profit or loss.   Monthly: Technically, the ratio topped in October 2008 and since 2011 has trended lower in a well-defined channel. That channel was broken in March 2022 as inflation exploded higher and the Federal Reserve began to tighten monetary policy (both actions hurt discretionary spending).   Over the last few months, as the outlook improved and the economic narrative changed to soft landing, the ratio has again turned lower and is now testing the area of the broken trendline that defined the broad down sloping channel.   MACD momentum remains on a sell signal.  In this perspective, I view the chart at an important juncture from which a sign of either strength or weakness is likely to define the trend for the next year.   Weekly Detail: Note the narrow Bollinger band and the turn higher over the last few weeks. A break above the lateral resistance coupled with a break of the downtrend would strongly suggest that staples are likely to outperform over coming months.   As a last step, I like to examine the raw bar charts on both sides of the spread. In this case, like the general market, both look weak. Discretionary is retreating from the top of its range while staples are resting at good support. The concern here would be that a breakdown from a long range of distribution would likely generate significant selling and imply significantly lower lows.   Conclusion: I suspect that the spread is in the process of bottoming and that, as the economy weakens over the next few months, staples will outperform. But, overt proof of a turn higher is lacking. While the recent hook higher is promising, it needs to move above the overhead resistance. If it does, odds become very good that the economy is weakening and that staples will enter a significant cycle of outperformance.

2023-10-23 13:33:37,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/RIVN/svWaOXyY-Rivian-Update-Retrace-Nearly-Complete/,"A follower had asked me to update on Rivian the other day so I figured I'd fill y'all in. Although I haven't been posting on it, I have still been tracking Rivian. We have been progressing nicely in our wave II retrace...almost too nicely.   We have completed our (A)-(B) waves and carved out what appears to be waves 1-4 of our C wave (working on the 4th or 5th now). What I expect to see next is a micro-5-wave count down to around the 1.382 fib line. We could extend out to the 1.618 though so be prepared for that. The secret is in the structure.   One thing I want to make you aware of is that we touched the 1.0 of the (A)-(B) wave and one could argue we have a completed structure for (C). If this is to be the case, we would want to see a HUGE jump up in a very bullish scenario to push us to high $30's - low $40's. The structure off of the $17.35 low doesn't seem bullish to me though. It's overlapping and corrective. For this reason, I believe we still have lower to go.   I will post if/when I make any trades on Rivian.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler"

2023-10-24 01:35:19,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/ARM/pTrjtVtW-Patent-Expirations-And-Competition-May-Limit-ARM-s-Market-Share/,"Key points   1. ARM is a leader with a saturated number of customers limiting future growth.   Its in a highly competitive landscape and needs to innovate beyond patent expirations in the 2030s.   2. As a controlled entity of SoftBank, I expect the board to push for buybacks in a bid to maximize returns.   3. I expect SoftBank to slowly unload its stake, while ARM buys back their stock - this may initially sustain the price.   Prospects Are Still Solid After IPO   ARM designs and licenses processors to manufacturers, it is the engineering company behind the worlds CPUs.   About 70% of the worlds population uses Arm-based products. More than 30 billion ARM-based chips (smartphones, small electronics, data centers, networking equipment) were shipped in FY '23, representing an approximately 70% increase since 2016.   Most of ARMs IP sales are in the United States, however a good combined portion are in East Asia, including China (PRC), Taiwan and South Korea.   The business model of the company is to design ARM-chips and license them out to manufacturers. It sells the intellectual property behind chips, but doesnt produce the hardware. This is an engineering-first company, with approximately 80% of global employees focused on research, design, and innovation. The company reaches scale with the ability to license out each CPU product to multiple companies.   ARM is a high performing company, with a gross margin of 80% and operating margins of 25%. The company made $2.7 billion in revenues in 2022 that stagnated in the IPO year.   Despite stagnating in its IPO year, its future prospects from here are still solid as demand for their IP continue to grow. But I dont believe itll grow revenues as fast as analysts are expecting (14% per year).   ARMs Market Share May Suffer As Patents Expire   Arm has an addressable market of $202.5 billion, and expects it to grow at a 6.8% annual rate to $246.6 billion by the end of 2025. The company estimates the aggregate value of chips containing Arm technology to be approx. $98.9 billion in 2022, representing 48.9% market share.   This market share is large even for a market leader. Competitors and expiring patents can become significant forces driving down the market share for ARM in the future. Notably most of the key ARM patents are expected to expire in the 2030s:   The expiration of these patents can open the door for more companies to design and manufacture ARM-based chips.   Limited New Customer Growth, But Opportunities in Smart Devices   More than 260 companies reported that they had shipped Arm-based chips in 2023, including:   Mobile computing: Apple, Guangdong OPPO, Samsung, Vivo Mobile, Xiaomi.   Cloud computing: AWS and Alibaba   Industrial IoT: Cruise and Mercedes-Benz, Raspberry Pi, Schneider Electric, and Siemens.   ARM also entered into a long-term agreement with Apple that extends beyond 2040 allowing the company to use Arm architecture for their CPUs.   The customer base for ARM is well established, and the company is at a phase where it will have a harder time acquiring new customers, rather it will have to rely on industry growth and innovation in order to increase revenue.   One of the highest-potential growth avenues for ARM is the smart devices vertical. ARMs CPU architecture fits well in small devices, giving it an advantage over peers with larger CPUs. As compute power increases, it will become more practical for consumers to rely on mobile devices and wearables instead of larger devices for everyday needs, this has the potential to widen the TAM.   Another growth avenue for the company is the market adoption of electronically rich vehicles and EVs as well as the capitalizing on government programs subsidizing EVs. Vehicles have an increasing number of processing demands both in central systems, and IoT linked sensors.   Selling Pressure From SoftBank May Limit Price Appreciation   ARM is a controlled entity owned by SoftBank Group with approximately 90.6% of their outstanding ordinary shares following the completion ARMs IPO.   Arms Top Shareholders   ARMs IPO is pushed by SoftBank who is looking to cash-in on their investment or escape with minimal losses. One scenario is to expect a continuous selling from SoftBank, which means that there may be selling pressure for some time keeping price appreciation moderate until the stock flips to a diversified investor base."

It doesn't mean that   GOOG   is headed for a bad report. Rather, retail investors are selling ETFs or moving money out of stocks into safe havens, or other adjustments to portfolios and 401(k)s. The selling dug into the most recent weak support level.   However,   GOOGL   has not sent out any advisor in recent weeks regarding its earnings report. Any company this size, and as a veteran company of the stock market, would warn if earnings were going to miss the retail-side analyst estimates. So this is a sympathy move merely because the retail-side selling is moving big-name companies down at this time.   If it has a great earnings report,   which the previous runs suggest   , then the HFTs may trigger a gap up at open tomorrow. Alphabet had improvement in its quarterly report last quarter.

If we take the fibo 424.77 to 417.81 the second bar closed on top and also above 38.2% levels.   At the same time we had a divergence in Elliott oscillator. For target we can draw a fibo from 420.46 to 417.81. That gave us 424.75 to 426.5.   High was 424.45. It was nearly 1:1 trade. Risky but worth it as it was steep fall last few days.   Now the rise 417.81 to 424.45 retraced to 61.8% around 420.5.   So, if we take the fall 424.45 to 420.25, we can expect a retracement to 422.5 levels.   As of now 412-414 looks more probable than 426-430 levels which is 100 and 200 averages.   As the moving averages are sloping downwards, we can expect a consolidation around 418-420.   So, upside I have 424.5 as target and downside 412-414 a target.   The first 15 minutes should give us a direction, hopefully."

A parallel downtrend consists of two downward sloping trend lines that chart the lower highs and lower lows of an asset over time. This break could signify a potential shift in investor sentiment and may be indicative of a forthcoming bullish cycle.   The break from a downtrend is often considered a bullish signal in technical analysis and could be followed by an upward momentum. However, traders should exercise caution and look for confirmation through other technical indicators such as volume, moving averages, or Relative Strength Index (RSI) to validate the trend reversal. High trading volumes accompanying the break could bolster the case for a sustained upward trajectory."

2023-10-23 16:10:31,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AMC/UpzcIxnP-Would-you-look-at-that/,"Well, well, well...   Would you look at that.   Just look at it.   Have we seen this pattern before?   Our old friend, Mr. Dragon, has returned and... What's this!?   The big guy is carrying a smole bebe dragon. How cute. So maybe it's a Mrs. Dragon??   This type of dragon bottom can be v powerful with these meme stocks, definitely something worth watching.   AMC   has been obliterated since the stock split, but it's smelling like reversal time and the previews have already started rolling.   AMC has been a big pumper in the past, so we could see a nice squeeze to the upside.   It's not weird to see these dragon bottoms run all the way up to the extreme 4.286 fib extension, especially with meme stocks.   Look how the 4.286 is lining up with the 200 MA (thin, squiggly, blue line). And don't forget to mind the gap up there (gold circle). It should get filled in time.   And if you think I'm crazy, CGC did something similar just a few weeks ago.   *Mwah*. Beautiful.

2023-10-24 15:06:58,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/ktgZiGlu-Tesla-Just-Had-Its-Worst-4Mo-Red-Combo-Nightmare-or-a-Chance/,"Tesla's stock just had its worst week of 2023, plunging 16% on Elon Musk's earnings-call nightmare.   Tesla   TSLA   shares plunged 16% over the five-day stretch ending October 20, as disappointing third-quarter earnings and a disastrous call led by CEO Elon Musk sparked a sell-off.   The nightmarish week wiped nearly $130 million off the EV maker's total market capitalization. while Musk's own personal fortune declined by around $30 billion, according to the   Bloomberg Billionaires Index   .   The stock is still up appr. 80% year-to-date, but has given up some of its gains over the past few months with the early-2023 hype around AI fading and investors starting to fret about the impact of higher interest rates.   Last Wednesday, on Oct 18, 2023 Tesla reported quarterly earnings that fell well short of Wall Street's expectations. The company posted adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.66, missing the consensus estimate of $0.74, and also underperformed analysts' revenue forecasts.   Musk then said in a post-earnings call that Tesla had likely ""dug  own grave with the Cybertruck"" due to enormous production challenges, and warned of several economic headwinds that could drag on demand.   Tesla just had its worst 4-months Red Combo since June 2023, while Tesla stocks price fading after that within four months in a row, from July till October (in this time).   Sure we can call this performance like a ""mini-disaster"", but still it's too early to say that world's richest man became a ""little baby"" who is ""fully in tears"".   Meanwhile strong and powerful technical analysis says that the carmaker's hellish string isn't a bad one, while buyout things right here to come.   Tesla stocks were doing well in June 2023, where bearish hugs and weekly SMA (52) were broken, so I have to say, there is almost no hellish right here, just a technical confirmation of reversal that has happened several months ago in 2023.   Tech graph below is a long-term view, with further updates on monthly/ quarterly basis."
2023-10-23 19:41:31,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/RSP/ctHzbhbl-SPX-Balance-of-Power/,"Not all is equal. And nothing is static.   Entropy is the foundation of our world, and it is the bane of a rich man's existence.   You collect in one spot, then nature comes up and spreads your work around.   Entropy is the unbeatable power of justice. In the end entropy always wins.   One has limited amount of time to temporary evade it.   Panta Rhei - Heraclitus   Everything flows. Money just like water, tends to move around. It is what it is meant to do.   Rich men need poor ones to collect from. In the end, there is nothing else to collect from the poorer ones. But the cycle must continue. No rich man could ever possibly give out wealth for free. Instead, they let nature do its trick and rebalance things.   I will now try to make a rough model of the changes in markets. Divide markets in distinct periods so as to have a better understanding on the progress of a bull market.   Energy Conservation   Money and entropy tend to spread out. When the stock market was ""invented"", few had the stocks and many had the money. Trading is a way to manipulate entropy to our advantage. We let nature spread what we don't need, and as a repayment we accumulate what we need. The stock market is like a   free energy machine   .   The invention of the stock market resulted in a massive wealth transfer, and ended with a painful crash; The Great Depression. The peak of the Roaring '20s was the peak of wealth accumulation from the few.   In the post-Great-Depression economy, money spread out again. From the few to the many.   In these decades, DJI (the big 30) stagnated while SPX (the 500) progressively got stronger.   But the big-30 had an ace up their sleve.   In trading the game must always go on. There is always a way to get richer.   And so, commodities became the new place for wealth to accumulate to.   From all of the above we have come to realize that bubble tops come when the few have accumulated the maximum possible from the many. DJI/SPX measures oligarchy, while the inverse SPX/DJI measures democracy in the spread of wealth in stocks.   Many bubbles and many crashes have followed after the Great Depression. The .com bubble crash and the GFC are memorable to young and old alike. And they all exhibit the same base structure. It is all the same, with one crucial difference.   The 2020 economy is vastly different from the 1920 economy.   The role of SPX and DJI has changed in the last few decades. DJI used to represent the companies that shaped bubbles and SPX the ones that followed. Now NDX and SPX are the indices that represent fast growth while DJI has taken the role of the ""index of stability"".   The modern balance-of-power measure is the following:   SPX-equal-weight divided by SPX-market-cap.   www.tradingview.com/...ven-off-at-the-pass/   Since I couldn't find an SPX-equal-weight index in TradingView, I have constructed a similar chart using two ETFs, RSP and IVV. The RSP/IVV chart is a good analogue to the standard chart.   And so, where do we conclude?   After much analysis we can say the following in retrospect.   The 2008 bubble was quick but with big repercussions.   Money democracy shows signs of impeding financial weakness.   And as for the post-2009 Bull Market...   We realize that it progressively turns into a bubble. While there is no definitive way to ""normalize"" SPX, SPX/M2SL proves a good candidate for absolute SPX cost.   Yield rates tell many tales.   Usually yield rates increase as the wide economy needs them. Strong economies need a lot of money and they can withstand high yield rates. And contrary to popular belief, yield rates are   positively   correlated with yield rates. Now however, the wide economy refuses to absorb such high yield rates. High production cost and high rates can destabilize the economy.   Money Democracy is Positively Correlated to Yield Rates.   Now we witness the wide economy refuse to absorb these yields.   This has resulted in unprecedented wealth accumulation from the few.   Speculation Chart:   While this type of analysis is subjective, it is interesting to see patterns repeat.   Composite Chart:   An experimental chart attempts to calculate the scale of the derivative bubble we are in.   We realize that equity prices are now lying. They are simply too inflated and riddled with derivatives to believe in.   All of that was quite complex to follow through, and even harder to make a conclusion.   In the end, the simplest analysis might be the best.   A massive bearish upward channel has formed. Now price has rejected once again off the ceiling. The real recession may have not even started yet...   Tread lightly, for this is hallowed ground.   -Father Grigori   Bonus Charts:   Have we reached a golden ceiling?"

This announcement has injected new life into the stock, and it's evident in the pre-market trading where VZ has surged by almost 4%.   The current outlook for VZ is highly favorable, and here's why: A bullish divergence is emerging on both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators, particularly on the weekly timeframe. This divergence suggests that the stock is poised for a recovery, possibly leading to a profitable swing trade opportunity for investors.   Furthermore, VZ presents an additional allure for long-term investors. With a generous dividend yield of over 8%, this stock becomes a compelling choice for those seeking a stable, income-generating investment.   In summary, the combination of robust earnings, a notable increase in FCF guidance, and the promising technical indicators on the chart indicate a strong potential for VZ to recover from recent losses. Whether you're looking for a shorter-term swing trade or a long-term income play, Verizon is shaping up as an attractive option in the current market landscape"

2023-10-24 17:38:51,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/PLTR/VCiSQycp-Palantir-Technologies-PLTR/,"Palantir stock is set to pop in the next year as the tech firm erects an artificial intelligence ""fortress"" that will help it become one of the biggest players in the AI race in the coming decade, Wedbush Securities analysts wrote on Friday.   According to Wedbush's Dan Ives, Palantir is headed to $25 a share in the next 12 months. That represents a surge of 54% from Thursday's closing price of $16.15. Shares were up 5.7% at $17.07 early Friday.   The data software firm, which has been funded in part by the CIA's In-Q-Tel venture capital arm, is the ""Messi"" of AI, Ives said, referring to Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi.   ""As we begin the 4th Industrial Revolution, Palantir is engaging in the widespread trend of various industries leveraging recent generative AI innovations to streamline operations and improve expense profiles,"" the Wedbush analysts wrote. Given Palantir's wide roster of partners in both the public and private spheres, Wedbush sees the next six to 12 months as a period of significant expansion for the company as it serves the growing demand for enterprise-scale large language AI models.   ""This is early innings on a sum-of-the-parts AI story just on the cusp on monetizing this massive green field AI opportunity,"" it predicted.   Palantir CEO Alex Karp has been a vocal proponent of the rapid development of AI even in the face of risks associated with the technology.   In an op-ed for the New York Times this week, he wrote that AI will shape political developments in this century in the same way that nuclear weapons drove geopolitics in the last century. He cautioned that there are risks, but they should not deter the continued advancement of AI. ""If these technologies are to exist alongside us over the long term, it will also be essential to rapidly construct systems that allow more seamless collaboration between human operators and their algorithmic counterparts, to ensure that the machine remains subordinate to its creator,"" he wrote. ""We must not, however, shy away from building sharp tools for fear they may be turned against us.""   Palantir is one of the most popular stocks, and for many, it's been a wild ride. Since the direct listing, investors have seen shares skyrocket to the high   30S   , crash to $5.84, and ride the AI boom back to the high teens. I invested in PLTR at the direct listing and purchased shares on the way up and as they declined in price. I was vocal about my dissatisfaction with how Alex Karp handled what has now become the infamous Q2 2022 conference call and became bullish again as PLTR turned things around. 2023 has been a strong year for PLTR as shares have increased by 182.47% YTD. Some investors have done well, while others got back to even or chipped away at the losses. Since May 5, shares have appreciated by 143.59%, appreciating from $7.41 to $18.05. Q2 2023 earnings are around the corner as PLTR is set to report post-market on August 7. Shares can continue higher into earnings and continue throughout 2023 if PLTR delivers growth across its revenue, earnings, customers, and contracts while maintaining its Q2 free cash flow (FCF) margins. In this article, I will discuss what I am looking for in the Q2 2023 earnings report and provide some insights as to what I think shares of PLTR could be worth in the future.   In 2021, PLTR made 45 official announcements through its website newsroom, and in 2022, PLTR had 44 announcements. PLTR has been busy in 2023; through July 18, they have made 26 official announcements. This doesn't include any of the blog posts PLTR has written discussing the work their conducting. I continuously research these aspects as they provide insight into what will be discussed on the earnings call and in the 10-Q. In Q2 2023, PLTR posted 14 press releases and another four in July. For PLTR to continue its growth trajectory, it needs more adaptation of its products in the government space as well as the private sector.   I expect PLTR to deliver strong growth numbers as there have been significant partnerships announced since April 1. On the government side, Palantir announced two deals with government entities in Ukraine, including the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine and the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. PLTR announced that Ukraine would utilize its technology to support the defense and reconstruction of the country and empower Ukraine investigators with critical data processing tools regarding 78,000 registered war crimes. US Special Operations Command entered a multi-year contract worth up to $463 million to expand its enterprise capabilities.   On the commercial side, PLTR expanded its cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), entered into an agreement to build an integrated management flow system on top of Foundry for CA Modas S.A, and expanded its partnership with Jacobs Solutions (J). These partnerships are critical because it will allow PLTR to expand throughout several sectors through some of the largest counterparts. I expect the Jacobs and Microsoft partnerships to be extremely beneficial in the coming years as more companies look to create value by enabling AI and moving toward data-driven decisions.   PLTR guided for revenue to come in at $528-$532 million in Q2 and revenue of $2.185-$2.235 billion for the full year. In Q1, PLTR delivered $525.2 million in revenue which is 24.04% of the low-end estimates and 23.5% of the high-end estimates for 2023. For PLTR to meet its 2023 full-year revenue guidance, it would need to generate an average of $553.27 million in Q2Q4 to meet the low-end projection and an average of $569.94 to meet the high-end estimates.   I expect PLTR to deliver at least $550 million in revenue for Q2 and discuss how they will increase incremental revenue throughout the year as more contracts continue to be initiated on an ongoing basis. If we see anywhere from $550-$575 million in revenue for Q2, it would be a strong indication that the high-end estimates will be met or exceeded when they report their 2023 fiscal year numbers. If PLTR records $550 million in Q2, $575 million in Q3, and $601 million in Q4, PLTR will generate $2.25 billion in annual revenue for 2023. This would be an average QoQ revenue increase of 4.6% over the next three quarters. I think it will be a strong signal coming off the AIP conference if PLTR is on track to beat the high-end estimates, as that would mean PLTR will be moving into the $600 million quarterly revenue bracket sometime in 2023 and inching their way closer to generating over $1 billion in revenue on a quarterly basis.   PLTR has now strung together two consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability and is projecting its adjusted income from operations coming in at $118-$122 million in 2023 and between $506-$556 million for their fiscal year. In Q1 2023, PLTR generated $125.11 million in adjusted income from operations, which is 24.73% of the low-end projection and 22.50% of the high-end estimate. This would mean that PLTR would need to increase its adjusted income throughout the year to meet its annualized projections.   I dislike adjusted numbers and prefer free cash flow (FCF) as it's harder to distort than other profitability measures. In Q1, PLTR generated $188.9 million in adjusted FCF, which is a 36% margin. PLTR's true FCF number was $182.6 million, as they generated $187.4 million in cash from operations and allocated $4.8 million toward CapEx. This places PLTR's FCF margin at 34.77%, which is the largest margin they have operated at since becoming a publicly traded company.   I have previously indicated that I believe PLTR can replicate similar growth to Salesforce (CRM). CRM currently has a market cap of $223.51 billion and, in the TTM, has generated $32.19 billion of revenue and $7.06 billion in FCF. Mr. Market is valuing CRM at a 6.94x multiple on sales, and 31.64x FCF. CRM has seen explosive growth over the last decade as its grown its revenue by 690.67% and its FCF by 1,125.54%. Including the TTM, CRM has operated at a 20.57% FCF margin over the previous five years.If PLTR finishes on the high-end of their revenue estimates for 2023 they would deliver $2.25 billion in revenue. PLTR's previous projections placed their 2025 revenue at $4 billion or more and I don't recall seeing updated estimates. If PLTR comes in on the high end of the 2023 projections and generates $2.25 billion, its YoY revenue growth would have decelerated from 41.11% in 2021 to 23.61% in 2022 and 18.12% in 2023. Hypothetically, if PLTR can grow its revenue at a 15% YoY basis over the next decade from 20242033, it would generate $2.98 billion in revenue for 2025 and $9.12 billion in 2033. At a 33% FCF margin in 2033, PLTR would generate $3 billion in FCF. At a 32x multiple on FCF, PLTR would be valued at $96.17 billion.   If PLTR can maintain an 18% YoY revenue growth rate and maintain a 33% FCF margin, PLTR will generate $11.78 billion in revenue and $3.89 billion in FCF in 2033. At a 32x FCF multiple, PLTR would be valued at $124.42 billion. If PLTR was to grow at a quicker pace of 21% YoY on average, they would generate $15.15 billion in revenue and $5 billion in FCF in 2033. Assigning a 32x multiple on their FCF would place PLTR at a $159.93 billion valuation.   Based on these assumptions, PLTR could grow between 151.49%-318.23% over the next decade, which would be an annualized return of 15.15%-31.82%. These are just assumptions regarding what could occur and why I feel PLTR could be a good long-term investment.   For those who think a 32x multiple on FCF is a crazy valuation, I am going to place a table below. Based on the current market caps, big tech has multiples from 31.29x to 221.31x. Putting the outliers aside, it's not uncommon to see companies trade in the 40x range. Even companies such as the Coca-Cola Company (KO) trade at a 29.90x multiple and PepsiCo (PEP) trade at a 45.41x multiple on FCF."

According to Elliot Wave theory the second phase of the move cannot be the shortest (from 2 to 3) , as such it gives me an idea that we may still have one more push up.   It also has a potential to create an inverse head / shoulder pattern on the longer time frame while moving closer to the Bitcoin halving.

2023-10-23 14:45:33,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NVDA/xR4VCbzp-NVDA-Informative/,"NVDA   Main Observations:   Trend: The overall trend for the depicted timeframe is bearish. The stock has been creating lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative of a downtrend.   Moving Averages: The stock price is below all the given moving averages, including EMA(9), EMA(50), and EMA(200). This further confirms the bearish sentiment in the stock. The short-term moving average (EMA9) is also below the longer-term moving average (EMA50), suggesting that the current momentum is to the downside.   Support and Resistance:   Bullish Line: The immediate support is marked at approximately $418.75. This is labeled as the ""Bullish Line"".   Bearish Line: If the stock breaches this support, the next key level to watch would be around $408.08, which is the ""Bearish Line"".   There are also several target prices outlined, suggesting potential points of resistance. The immediate resistance seems to be around $424.80, with subsequent target prices at $431.54 and $439.38.   Volume: There's a noticeable spike in volume on the 16th, indicating increased trading activity on that day. High volume can be indicative of strong interest in a stock, but without the direction of the candle, it's hard to determine if it was buying or selling pressure.   Descending Trendline: The black descending trendline indicates that the stock has been respecting this line as a dynamic resistance. For any bullish reversal, it would be essential for the stock to break this trendline.   RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI is nearing the oversold territory (below 30). As of the last data point on the chart, the RSI is around 25. When the RSI is below 30, it suggests the stock may be oversold, which can sometimes be an indication that it may reverse or have a bounce soon. However, it's important to note that stocks can remain oversold for extended periods during strong downtrends.   Concluding Thoughts:   The chart indicates a bearish trend for NVIDIA in the given timeframe. For any significant bullish reversal, the stock would need to break above the descending trendline and move past the mentioned resistance levels. The nearing oversold condition in RSI might suggest a potential bounce or reversal, but it would be crucial to monitor other confirming signals. Always consider cross-referencing these observations with other indicators and factors before making any trading decisions."

2023-10-24 17:41:54,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AMD/Gx75pE4y-Advanced-Micro-Devices-AMD/,"Team RED is READY   As with any competitor, a quarterly earnings report from a peer can provide great insight into the market. For Advanced Micro Devices, the Q2'23 earnings report from Intel provides great views on the surging demand for AI chips and a rebound in PC demand crucial for AMD   The most immediate signal from Intel beating Q2'23 estimates and guiding up for Q3 is the rebound in PC demand. Most importantly, the inventory correction appears over with OEMs no longer digesting chip inventory.Back in Q3'22, AMD shocked the market by cutting PC revenue estimates by $1 billion. The company quickly went from $2 billion in quarterly CPU sales for PCs to less than $1 billion.   Intel still reported Q2 Client Computing revenue was down 12% YoY to $6.8 billion, but the number was up $1.0 billion sequentially. The chip giant guided up Q3 revenue to $13.4 billion, up $0.5 billion sequentially.In Q1'23, AMD reported that client revenues had fallen further to only $739 million. AMD CPU revenues are now far over $1 billion per quarter below the peak levels providing substantial upside potential when the PC market normalizes.   Intel discussed a mixed picture for their business in the near term due to AI. The chip giant is seeing a wallet share shift from the sever CPU spend towards AI chips.The move is both good and bad for AMD. The company has the MI300 AI GPU chip hitting the market in Q4 providing a strong competitor to the booming demand for the H100 from Nvidia, but the chip isn't out on the market yet.   In the near term, AMD may see some suppressed data center demand while heading into 2024. Ultimately, the company should see upside from AI demand for the MI300 along with the Alveo AI accelerator.On the Q2'23 earnings call, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger suggested the AI pipeline for 2024 had surged to $1 billion: In my formal remarks, we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline, 6x in the last quarter.   Going back a few months, Morgan Stanley had estimated the AI potential for AMD was only $400 million with upside potential to $1.2 billion. The Intel forecasts would suggest the AI potential for AMD is far higher next year when the MI300 is in full-scale production.   Nvidia guided up current quarter sales estimates by 50% to over $11 billion. The company suggested data center sales would reach $7+ billion in the quarter.   AMD has only seen data center sales reach $1.3 billion in quarterly sales leaving a huge gap from Nvidia. Even Intel still hit $4.0 billion in data center sales during Q2'23, though the amount is down nearly 20% form 2022 levels due in part to losing market share to AMD.   The big issue for AMD is whether data center sales growth stalls causing a miss to 2H sales targets while booming AI demand ultimately boosts sales starting in Q1'24, or maybe Q4. The chip company peaked at quarterly sales of $6.6 billion back Q2'22 and the current quarterly analyst estimates aren't very aggressive.   A rebound in PC demand to more normalized levels places AMD back at the Q4'23 revenue target of $6.5 billion alone. A PC rebound to normal digestion ($2 billion quarterly run rate) along with higher data center or AI demand leads to vastly higher revenues in 2024.   The current analysts aren't even factoring in much growth in the Q2'24 revenue estimate of $6.76 billion. The amount is just 4% upside from Q2'22 despite potentially surging demand from AMD entering the AI GPU space.   AMD is set to report earrings after the close on August 1. Investors should focus less on the Q2 numbers or even Q3 guidance and focus more on a return to more normalized revenue levels plus the upside from AI.Our view has long held that AMD has the earnings potential of $5 to $6 and the AI opportunity is all upside to this view.   The key investor takeaway is that AMD is still $50 below all time highs while Nvidia has soared over $100 above the late 2021 highs. Investors should use the current weakness in AMD to load up on the stock while leaving some capital to buy any weakness following Q2 earnings due to the potential for near term disappointment leading to long term opportunities."

The focal point of the auto giants earnings release will be its global wholesale volumes from the Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments.   Q2 Highlights   Ford reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share for second-quarter 2023, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents and increased from 68 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Higher-than-expected automotive revenues resulted in the outperformance. The companys consolidated second-quarter revenues came in at $44,954 million, rising 11.8% year over year.   In the second quarter, total wholesale volume in the Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments increased 7% year over year to 720,000 units and 8% year over year to 365,000, respectively. EBIT from Ford Blue and Pro units came in at $2,308 million and $2,391 million, respectively.   Ford reported adjusted free cash flow (FCF) of $2,919 million during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $26,406 million as of Jun 30, 2023. Long-term debt, excluding Ford Credit, totaled $19.17 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023.   Factors at Play   While Ford Blue focuses on the firms legacy gas-powered business, Ford Pro deals with commercial vehicles and services. Expected higher year-over-year growth in global wholesale shipments and adjusted EBIT from these segments are likely to have positively impacted Fords upcoming results.   Our estimate for global wholesale shipments from Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments is pegged at 750,000 and 382,000 units, suggesting a year-over-year uptick of 1.2% and 19%, respectively. Our forecast for third-quarter Ford Blue and Ford Pro adjusted EBIT implies an uptick of 6.2% and a whopping 370.1% on a year-over-year basis.   The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty set the stage for promising results for the Ford Pro segment. In the quarter under discussion, Ford's commercial vans, led by the Transit van, continued to perform strongly. Transit van sales surged by 28.3%, with 34,006 vans sold, maintaining its position as America's top-selling commercial van. Ford E-Series vans also saw a 13.4% increase in the third quarter. Ford held the top spot in commercial sales, with a 40.5% market share, up 2.1% from the previous year. The Ford Pro segment is expected to have benefited from high demand for E-Transit vans. In the third quarter, the California Vanpool Authority (CalVans) announced the purchase of over 400 new Ford E-Transit vans through Model 1, a leading electric school bus distributor, expanding its fleet by 40% and reducing its fuel and CO2 emissions in California.   Ford Blue segment is set to reflect benefits from high ICE-powered vehicles, which rose 5.4% year over year to 444,681 units in the third quarter of 2023. Notably, the 2024 Ford Mustang debuted in August and for the third quarter, it recorded 9,844 sales, with the first full month of sales occurring in September. Notably, 67% of the Mustang's third-quarter sales, equating to 6,575 units, were realized in September.   Overall Earnings & Revenue Projections   Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford as it has the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before theyre reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   The company has an Earnings ESP of +14.57% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 6 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. F currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."

The support at 3.57 is strong since the quotes have not approached it for over a year. If the descending trend continues, a ""false"" breakout will likely form from this level, followed by a trend change.   On the H1 timeframe, if quotes return to 3.57, the next target for the price increase can be around 4.30. In this case, a rebound from support on D1 is expected.

The software specialist's share price was up 12% few hours. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.   EngageSmart published a press release before the market opened this morning that it was on track to be acquired by Vista Equity and bought out for approximately $4 billion, working out to a price of $23 per share.   EngageSmart is poised to be bought in an all-cash deal Vista Equity's buyout price of $23 per share for EngageSmart represented a 14% premium compared to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) specialist's valuation at Friday's market close. The all-cash deal is expected to close in next year's first quarter. Based on EngageSmart's current share price, investors who bought the stock right now would see a gain of approximately 1.6% upon the buyout's completion.   Is now the time to buy EngageSmart stock? The chances of any antitrust issues blocking the acquisition are seemingly nonexistent. While it's very likely that Vista Equity will complete its buyout, now is not the time to buy EngageSmart stock. If you already own the stock, now could be a good time to take profits.   At its current price, EngageSmart offers minimal upside. On the other hand, the stock could see substantial sell-offs in the unlikely event that the buyout were to be called off or delayed.   The deal will almost certainly be completed, but investors can probably put their money to better use. Low-risk bonds and some savings accounts can provide similar or better rates of return with far lower downside risk. So even investors who are looking for small, short-term gains have better options at their disposal right now."
2023-10-24 01:25:46,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/ABNB/DE1aDOro-Airbnb-NASDAQ-ABNB-Worth-Watching/,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.   Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.   Airbnb's Improving Profits   In the last three years Airbnb's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Airbnb's EPS catapulted from US$1.98 to US$3.60, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 82% year-on-year growth like that.   Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Airbnb shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 19% to 22% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.   Are Airbnb Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?   We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$80b company like Airbnb. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$23b. Coming in at 29% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.   While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Airbnb, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.   The Airbnb CEO received total compensation of just US$311k in the year to December 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.   Is Airbnb Worth Keeping An Eye On?   Airbnb's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Airbnb is worth considering carefully. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Airbnb by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry."

2023-10-24 00:32:02,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/V/l8LPdRxA-VISA-Poised-For-Greatness/,"Visa processes more than $11.6 trillion in gross dollar volume (GDV), made up primarily of digital payments with the remainder being things like ATM withdrawals, B2B transactions, etc. Alongside Mastercard, which is en-route to process $9.2 trillion, this makes Visa one of the two largest payment processors in the world. The company evidently has a wide moat that is targeted by competitors and regulators.   While many competitors such as Block (SQ) and Paypal (PYPL) seek to penetrate the high-margin space, Visa is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of digital payments and serve as a foundation for digital transactions with a wide moat that can be difficult to substitute.   Digital payments, a core part of Visas transaction value, are estimated (2) to reach a $9.5 trillion GDV in 2023, and grow to $12 trillion in 2025.   The Credit Card Competition Act May Be A Major Negative Catalyst   Acknowledging that the passing of this act is not a given, investors may see a large portion of the profits of payment processors like Visa wiped out should this law pass. In its current proposition, the legislation would enable merchants to choose an alternative payment processor (one that isnt Visa or Mastercard) to execute payments for their customers.   Merchants instead of customers are the ones covering payment processing fees, so they have a large incentive to route payments to the cheapest competitor. Inevitably, Visa will be forced to lower their payment fees to compete with these cheaper alternatives, thereby compromising a key income stream.   Large companies like Walmart and Amazon will especially benefit from this change as they stand to reduce the fees paid to processors like Visa and Mastercard.   I estimate that this bill or a compromised version of it will pass, and erode Visas oligopolistic moat, and therefore their margins and net profits.   Visa Will Only Capture 30% of Serviceable Addressable Market   In 2021, the US value of non-cash payments was estimated to be over $128.51 trillion   I estimate a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of $100 trillion to $150 trillion, based off data from the US plus the rest of the world.   But I think that a more realistic Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM - What Visas share of the TAM could be) for Visa is between $50 trillion and $75 trillion.   Alternative data estimates indicate that the global SAM for card networks will grow to $60 trillion in 2027. Of the SAM midpoint of $62.5 trillion by 2028, I estimate that Visa manages to capture 30% resulting in a GDV of $18.75 trillion.   Visa had a take rate of about 0.2247% for the last 9 months, up 9.4% YoY from 0.2054%. Assuming Visa captures my estimated GDV of $18.75 trillion, the revenue in 2028 comes up to $42.2 billion (5.8% CAGR revenue growth)   As most of the developed world already prefers cards, Visa will find it more difficult to open up international markets, so I expect the company to reach this high-point.   The International Segment Is A Primary Revenue & Growth Driver   Much of Visas growth comes from international markets, and there are two key verticals to watch for the company: e-commerce and B2B cross-border payments which is very pivotal VISA.   E-commerce is growing rapidly, and Visa is the leading payment processor for online transactions, making it well-positioned to capture this growing market.   Visa is also expanding into business-to-business (B2B) payments and cross-border payments. These markets have a lot of potential, and Visa is investing heavily to capitalize on these opportunities."

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.06%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.93%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.2%.   The gold and copper mining company's shares have seen a decrease of 5.41% over the last month, not keeping up with the Basic Materials sector's loss of 4.64% and the S&P 500's loss of 3%.   The upcoming earnings release of Barrick Gold will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Barrick Gold to post earnings of $0.23 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 76.92%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $3 billion, indicating a 18.67% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.   In terms of the entire fiscal year, Dexwirenews predict earnings of $0.87 per share and a revenue of $11.88 billion, indicating changes of +16% and +7.85%, respectively, from the former year.   Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Barrick Gold. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.   Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.   In terms of valuation, Barrick Gold is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.03. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.47.   It's also important to note that GOLD currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.46. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Mining - Gold was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.9 at yesterday's closing price.   The Mining - Gold industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 190, placing it within the bottom 25% of over 250 industries."
2023-10-23 23:46:09,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/USO/jYaBuVgI-Oil-Leading-Dollar-Lower-Watch-Oil/,"Rising yields have lead to a massive sell-off in OIL markets foreshadowing: tighter economic conditions, cheaper energy prices and lower inflation prints - ultimately resulting in a weaker dollar / stronger euro in the short term. Globally inflation took off mainly as a result of covid stimulus exacerbated by Russias invasion of Ukraine. Even though the war is far from over the supply chain kinks / export bans caused from it are mainly resolved. Lower natural gas prices result in cheaper fertilizer and food. Cheaper oil reduces manufacturing and transportation costs. Higher yields and higher energy prices are a cure for themselves.   If a Dollar pullback / Euro rally is expected, a rally in risk assets will ensue. Lower inflation leads to greater speculation of a soft landing ultimately resulting in softer economic conditions - beneficial for risk assets. I believe Oil has shown the markets hand and is notifying us of weakness in yields/dollar. Gold may look to breakout of its 3 year range between $1600-$2000.  A return to pre-war levels for the dollar will give Gold and risk assets a boost. On a longer time period, I remain bearish EURO / bullish Dollar in the long term as I believe the economy remains resilient elevating inflation into next - dispelling the soft landing scenario. However in the next 3-6 months, I can envision a weaker Dollar and all that comes with it.   Supporting Charts will be posted below."

However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.99%.

2023-10-23 13:17:26,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/POR/WQDWC4Bu-Portland-General-Electric-POR-to-Report-a-Decline-in-Earnings/,"Portland General Electric (POR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.   The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.   While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.   This electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -30.8%.   Revenues are expected to be $770.34 million, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.   Estimate Revisions Trend   The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 43.48% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.   Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.   Earnings Whisper   Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the  Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.   The  Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.   Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.   A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.   Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).   How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Portland General Electric?   For Portland General Electric, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.   So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Portland General Electric will beat the consensus EPS estimate.   Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?   Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.   For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Portland General Electric would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of -6.38%.   Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.   Bottom Line   An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.   That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.   Portland General Electric doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."

We are seeing a push back towards this zone with the formation of a bearish wedge that is more likely to break to the down side than the upside.

2023-10-24 14:32:22,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/COIN/rQ8UAeuA-Coinbase-Gearing-Up-for-its-next-Move/,"Hi guys! This is an Update on recent Technical developments found for Coinbase (COIN).   I've successfully identified the Inverse Head & Shoulders Pattern. Check out that idea down below.   We have completed the Return Rally back to test Support on the Neckline. Now ive been assessing if there are signs that we continue the Inverse Head and Shoulders with our final explosive breakout move.   This analysis is done on the 1 day timeframe.   As you can see we have tested and CONFIRMED Support on the Neckline.   After doing so we have inched higher.   Notice now, we are ABOVE the 21 EMA.   With the last 3 days of candles, forming LOWER WICKS off the 21 EMA.   This is a great sign of SUPPORT.   We must continue to stay ABOVE the 21 EMA.   Being Above the 21 EMA on any timeframe indicates that we will most likely have an UPTREND in price.   Notice also the Orange Rectangle. This highlights a consolidation zone. This shows to me that we are building up momentum for our final rally of the Inverse Head & Shoulders Pattern.   A confirmation ABOVE the Upper Border of Rectangle, will indicate Rally may be starting.   To keep us on our toes, just remember that if price action goes BELOW the Lower Border of the Rectangle, we risk testing the Neckline again. Which is always a   possibility   . As long as we maintain the Neckline as Support, we good.   Watch VOLUME -> We need it to start picking up for indication of the major move.   This move will essentially lead to trend reversal  for COIN, confirming the bottom.   __________________________________________________________________________________   Thank you for taking the time to read my analysis.

2023-10-23 19:26:23,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AAPL/5wmccMel-AAPL-Bear-Swings-Forecast/,"AAPL looks like it might be setting up a break.   For a break I'd want to see 155 hitting at least.  Maybe some bounce in this area to 165 and then from there us trading around 150.   If these swings hit, I think we'll rally off them. I'm probably a buyer at 150 - but I think we'll have seen a break.   It may take multiple months to set up after, but I think this would signal AAPL entering a bear market."
2023-10-23 16:14:19,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AMZN/B3UpVIvC-Think-Before-You-Short-AMZN-Earnings/,"Traders need to check weekly charts when considering selling short stocks at this time. Many times there are strong support levels close to the current sold down price action.   The weekly charts also provide more data for day and swing traders to determine the all important RUN GAIN POTENTIAL. This must be calculated before any trade to determine the Risk versus Profit Potential for that trade, regardless of whether the hold time is a few minutes or several days for swing trading.   For many stocks, the recent selling down is not due to weaker earnings expectations but due to an overall reaction to retail news regarding international conflicts, US government uncertainties and regional wars.   The key element for trading stocks short-term is to understand where support will kick in and halt a sell short trade. Understanding the functionality and the strength or weakness of a support level is crucial to attaining a high-profit trade.   It is also a factor if you are waiting on the Dark Pool Buy Zone levels for getting into the stock for a run up from support levels.   Below is a chart of AMZN, which reports earnings on Thursday this week after the market close.   It shows that support is strong near the current price level. This indicates that the Dark Pool Buy Zone is within that technical price range. Selling short is inherently higher risk as the support level is a long-term trend strong support.   Why is it so strong?   1. There is a several-week price range that held the stock up.   2. Highs are a support mechanism when the stock market is not in a long-term downtrend. ALL   traders should know that this is not a bear market. Indexes are in a Trading Range.   3. The length of the candles is significant and relevant to the strength of the support."

If you see the day's price action you'll see that we couldn't even reclaim 262 or close at a weekly high.   Today, there was bad news and pumped $10 from the bottom. Yes we played calls here today (and a failed $40 lotto put), but that doesn't mean this price action is sustainable.   Anyway, ""fundamentals"" aside, let's look at some price action:   Buyers pushed the price up from blue TL.   Failed to make a new high. Forming a left shoulder.   Buyers went a little higher this time, but failed again.   Back down to blue TL. I alerted calls here and shares. Paid nicely!   Now, this week, buyers failed to reclaim 262 resistance and enjoyed a fake pump on Friday to close the week.   What happens next is either blue TL dip or white TL dip.   More likely is a white TL dip because that would be 3rd touch on white TL and 4th touch on blue TL. 4th is usually bearish. 3rd is bullish.   I'll buy again on white TL.   Hope this is helpful for you. We've been making fire calls all month. Welcome to follow or let me know how this is helping you.   TSLA   SPY   US100   NAS100"
2023-10-23 16:01:42,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BAND/DRPiBLH5-My-Favorite-AI-Play-Bandwidth-BAND/,"Bandwidth (BAND) is my favorite AI play right now.   The chart looks really bad! I get it. Today, it trades for below even its IPO price.   But the reason why I think it's an AI play ready to double, possibly triple, is a fundamental reason that I'll explain in this post.   First of all, let me state something very interesting about Bandwidth - today it's one of the worst performing stocks in the entire market since 2020 and 2021. I don't entirely know why that's the case, but I do think the market has overreacted.   Let me now get the bad news out of the way: when BAND's stock was flying high, management took out several large loans to expand faster and grow globally. Those gains are starting to be realized, but it's key to mention this as the debt profile is still somewhat high. The question now is: can they keep paying it off? They're on target to have little to no debt within the next few years.   Okay, so why is Bandwidth an AI play? To understand this you need to know that Bandwidth is essentially the connector for data that is transmitted over the web. Bandwidth's platform helps data, messages, voice calls, video calls, email, and more travel from Point A to Point B.   For example, when you make a call on Zoom or even Slack or Google Hangouts, it's highly likely your call is being routed over Bandwith's network. The point is, Bandwidth is the toll keeper, the train conductor, for most modern communications that are triggered at scale.   So how does AI fit into this?   That's where this gets good. All of these AI companies NEED a company to help deliver the information to their end consumer. If OpenAI creates a chatbot that works on text message or sends push notifications or can even speak over calls, Bandwidth will most likely be the resource that delivers that information from business to consumer.   What's even more interesting is call centers and the future of talking to call centers to get help or support. In one scenario, you upload all your most frequently asked questions, pair it with an AI service, and then let users call that AI service over the Bandwidth network and now an AI customer support agent is solving issues at scale.   This is just one example.   I could go on and on.   But that's my play!   I own a little Bandwidth and will be watching closely in the coming years."

This has been done before in previous ideas that I have provided and the concept is pretty straight forward. Sometimes the price can just follow a shape and not bounce from it, but I consider that to be an interesting occurrence as well.   The purple zone is a zone where no drawings were simulated/required.

We are still waiting to hear from Powell in regards to further rate hikes, and the market is currently expecting one more hike with no real major cuts for 2024.   I will be looking out for the following statement during the next FOMC:   Powell decides to raise one more time according to the Dot Plot, however state that the comity has reached their goal of sufficiently restrictive territory with no more further rate hikes.   However, he will be adamant that rates will remain higher for longer, and the Fed will monitor live data to make future decisions.
