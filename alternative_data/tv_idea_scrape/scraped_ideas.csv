Perfectly suitable for a long-term uptrend to continue   Gold extended its weekly advance and climbed to the $1,990 area for the first time in five months on Friday. XAU/USD continues to benefit from safe-haven flows as investors look to mitigate risk, while a correction in US bond yields provides further impetus.   Gold prices (XAU/USD) rose sharply as tensions in the Middle East continued to escalate and Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell endorsed a stable interest rate policy in a speech on Thursday.   Demand for gold bars increased as the Israeli army prepared to enter the Gaza Strip with the goal of destroying Hamas, the Palestinian military group.

That's all it took for Bitcoin to complete its retrace after hitting $28,000 in early October.   Today, we have a full green candle... Questions:   (1) How did we get here?   (2) Is this type of outcome predictable?   (3) Did the market provide any clues?   If you are reading this you obviously follow me and if you follow me you know the answer to these questions.   (2) Is this type of outcome predictable? 100%.   The market provided us with endless clues such as the weekly timeframe (EMA200), the Altcoins market (those growing strong), Gold (bullish breakout), the DXY (going bearish) on and on...   See more here   .   (3) Did the market provide any clues?   Information is still coming in.   The market is providing us with plenty of data as to what is going to happen next.   Bitcoin is set for massive growth, ""38,000 in November"" (the 2nd part of the failed prediction), beyond 40,000 or maybe even 50,000 or 60,000 by the end of this bullish wave.   (1) How did we get here?   Almost an entire year of higher highs and higher lows.   A very long/drawn-out consolidation phase, from March through October, so the next move out to be really strong.   Analysis   Bitcoin closed yesterday above EMA50, it is really early in this bullish wave.   We can expect growth for months... Bears gone get REKT.   Ok, never mind that...

The rally was fueled by slower inflation and hype over artificial intelligence.   But more recently, the Federal Reserve's unwavering higher-for-longer rate stance and a deepening bond-market rout have had a sobering effect on equities sentiment, with the S&P 500 index halving its year-to-date gains.   Indeed stock valuations are looking increasingly stretched, raising the risk of a correction.   One such indicator in particular is flashing   RED   - the relative valuation of stocks versus the debt market.   SPX / ICE BofA Corporate Total Return Index   In August this year, the S&P 500   SPX   climbed to levels last seen during the peak of dot-com boom, relative to an index that tracks the US corporate bond market.   The gauge is still holding near those highs, despite the recent pullback in equities.   The metric last surged this high in the spring of 2000  and that was followed by a multi-year meltdown in stocks that saw the S&P 500 crash 50% between March 2000 and October 2002.   SPX 50% Decline During 2000-2002   Another indicator that shows the richness of stocks relative to debt is the so-called equity risk premium  or the extra return on shares over government debt, which is considered a safer form of investment. The metric has plunged this year lows unseen in decades, indicating elevated stock valuations.   ""Equity risk premium is near its worst ever level going back to 1927. In the 6 instances this has occurred, the markets saw a major correction & recession/depression - 1929, 1969, 99/00, 07, 18/19, present,"" research firm MacroEdge said in a   recent post on X   (ex-Twitter).   The so-called equity risk premium (earnings yield minus bond yield) recently fell to a new cycle low and remains well below historical averages. In other words, the stock market has become more expensive relative to the bond market despite the recent pullback.   Meanwhile the main graph (quarterly Div-adjusted chart for   TLT   20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) illustrates perhaps right there could the end for U.S. Govt Bond Market decline, with Double top as a further projected/ targeted upside price action.   Will all of that bring U.S. stock market to 50% decline like in early 2000s!?   Time will show!"

2023-10-22 17:03:53,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/XAUUSD/BEcL4ZYo-XAUUSD-The-rally-took-prices-to-new-highs/,"XAUUSD   MARKET ANALYSIS AND COMMENTARY - October 23-October 27   After opening at 1,926 USD/oz, international gold prices fell to 1,908 USD/oz, then continuously increased sharply to 1,997 USD/oz and closed this week at 1,980 USD/oz.   The reason international gold prices increased sharply this week is due to the increasing conflict between Israel and Hamas, causing gold's role as a safe haven to increase sharply.   After Hamas launched a terrible attack on Israel on October 7, many predicted that this conflict would only be a limited conflict between Israel and Hamas. But that argument became less convincing after the horrific explosion on October 17 at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, where many displaced Palestinians were taking refuge.   But even before the tragedy at al-Ahli hospital, the scale of Hamas attacks and the ongoing reality in the Gaza Strip were changing the strategic calculations of the parties involved. Those changes are putting a full-blown conflict in the region at risk of breaking out, especially the risk of confrontation between Iran and Israel.   If there is a confrontation between Israel and Iran, not to mention a full-scale war in the Middle East, it could destabilize the region, disrupt global markets, and cause great harm to civilians. , attracting American forces and perhaps even pushing Iran to weaponize its nuclear capabilities.   Thus, the Israel-Hamas conflict still has many potential risks leading to a comprehensive war in the region, especially a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran. This could push crude oil prices up sharply, causing the world economy to face the risk of more instability and sharp increase in inflation in the context of monetary tightening with almost no room left. Therefore, gold will continue to be backed by the Israel-Hamas conflict.   However, buying gold as a geopolitical safe haven has never proven to be sustainable. Therefore, gold prices will face the risk of a strong sell-off when the Israel-Hamas conflict temporarily subsides or prolongs without results.   In addition to the Israel-Hamas conflict, the US's third quarter GDP data and September personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index will attract special attention from investors. Although the Israel-Hamas conflict may still influence gold prices, if these figures have a sudden increase/decrease, it will still have a strong impact on gold prices next week.   TECHNICAL ANALYSIS   XAUUSD   Looking at the technical chart in frame D1, we can see that the gold price increased continuously from the threshold of 1810 to close to the round resistance mark of 2000, successively breaking through the resistance marks of 1885-1950-1985. Next week, if the geopolitical situation calms down, gold may re-enter the correction cycle. The trading plan for next week will consider the buying season around 1925, the selling season around 2010."
2023-10-22 15:29:33,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/EURUSD/yjk8jWgn-100-PIP-strategy-for-next-week/,"Hello dear friends! It's the end of another trading week! Let's recap the market from last week and discuss our new plans for the upcoming week, shall we?   Overall, the downward trend of EURUSD continued last week. The strong support level at 1.067 couldn't make the EU turn around, and the downward trend persisted. Currently, EU has temporarily halted trading activities and reached a level of 1.059. The trend from last week was mostly sideways as the price faced a strong support level at 1.054 (as shown on the 1d chart).   However, investors still lack the motivation to push the price back up. With the current trend, there is a possibility of a price increase next week, but it may not last long as it approaches the resistance level. There is evidence that once it touches the resistance level, it will resume its downward movement, as indicated by the unchanged EMA.   What are your thoughts on EURUSD?"

At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market is trading below the $30,000 barrier. The upward trend is strong as it consolidates at high levels with stable trading activity on a 2-hour timeframe.   As a result, there is eager anticipation for SEC approval of proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund transactions. This has contributed to making the market hotter than ever. It is expected that this price increase will reach $31,209. What are your thoughts on this matter? Do you agree with me?"

At that level we ideally wanted to see resistance in order to attempt the short trade back down, however, considering the volume on the long side we reverted to the bias and levels through the later part of the week which entailed long trades into 1990-2 where we got a minor tap and bounce before the close.   So, what can we expect in the week ahead?   Again this week we would like to see how the market opens and how the price reacts to the lower support regions 1975 and below that 1968.  Based on these levels holding price we have potential now to attack and break open the 2000 level with the first target region of 2015 to the upside.   On the flip, breaking below the 1968 price level aggressively, should give us an opportunity to then find resistance and short the market back down in to the first level of order region 1950-55 where price will need to stay above to attempt higher pricing.   The key level here for the early sessions is 1997-99, if defended, as shown on the chart, we should see some form of pullback into the lower regions.   KOGs bias for the week:   Bullish above 1970 with targets above 1999 and above the 2015   Bearish on break of 1970 with targets below 1955 and below that 1937   Please do support us by hitting the like button, leaving a comment, and giving us a follow.

The toned-down rhetoric from officials at the Federal Reserve has limited global USD supply, making gold hotter than ever.   At the time of writing, the gold market has temporarily halted trading, facing a close on Friday while still testing crucial resistance levels at its highest point since July 1987. Breaking decisively above would confirm that the weeks-long downward pressure has been slowly diminishing. Such a breakthrough would ensure a reevaluation of bearish prospects. Furthermore, surpassing the May 2072 peak is shifting midterm prospects towards an upward trend. My current target is to aim for the two highest resistance levels at $2071. With another test looming as the 1M timeframe trend remains stable.   What about you? Do you agree with my viewpoint?"

2023-10-22 20:55:00,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BTCUSD/luzotqxI-Bitcoin-Poised-To-Break-30K/,"Bitcoin short squeeze continues to the 30K resistance. In terms of momentum this move is significant and should shape smaller time frame strategies, BUT the bigger picture is another story. New resistance is the 31K AREA, new support is 27.5 to 28.5 AREA.   Based on the new developments in price structure, I suspect a potential test of 31K BUT I believe a break is low probability. A test of the 28.5 to 27.5 support area is more likely in my opinion over the coming week.   The bullish move (sparked by fake news apparently) appears to be a short squeeze. These type of moves are NOT sustainable over the long run and is nothing more than traders getting shaken out of short positions.   Gold has also expressed a similar move almost touching 2K. We can sit here and entertain ourselves as to ""why"" this may be and why it should continue. We can also watch Youtube videos featuring rocket ships on their title thumbnails (how original!). The REALITY is interest rates are at their highs (see US10Y). As long as money is getting more expensive to borrow, the probability of Bitcoin going beyond 31K is LOW.   Sure this may also be money looking for safety, but it is most likely temporary. Sustainable rallies and asset bubbles are driven by cheap money, NOT temporary catalysts based on fear.   IF Bitcoin cannot clear 31K decisively over the next week, then I will be looking for the test of the newly established support 28.5 to 27.5K (see drawing on chart). I would consider shorting this to be aggressive since it is against price structure. Waiting for bullish setups around 28K would be conservative. Either way, day trades or swing trades are most appropriate at these levels, these are not attractive levels for investing.   Thank you for considering my analysis and perspective."

2023-10-22 22:51:08,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/LINKUSD/H4bIQnPV-It-s-Time-Chainlink-Rally/,"Start here:   At the bottom of the comments of the TA above links to the next in the chain.   We have been 518 days in this range; you have had 518 days to buy Chainlink under 8 dollars.   I have been following this range for a very long time, and now I believe it's time we finally break it to the upside. The bar pattern keeps on playing out perfectly, so the next step of the fractal is a test of the top of the range with a break this time.   If you looked at the TA I linked above, you should know that we have been following a very specific bar pattern.   Chainlink had a small pullback at the top of the range back in 2019, which is very similar to what's happened right now. In 2019 there was a  pulled back to the 0.618 Fib before making the big move out of the range and now we have a pullback to the 0.5Fib very similar moves.   According to the bar pattern, we will break the range in the next 7 to 10 days. Once that happens, the chances are there will be a multi-month rally, which is not to be confused with a bull market rally because the bull market does not start until the end of 2024.   If you've been procrastinating about buying Chainlink, your time is up. We looked at Chainlink's history; we know that after a break in the range, we could get a very aggressive move. There won't be time.   I think I have covered everything in the last few TAs on Chainlink. The time is now; the trade is simple:   2XL leveraged Chainlink tokens on Bybit, and we hold till December 2023. Whatever the price20, 35, or 50that trade will be closed based on time and the bar pattern fractal.   So to conclude:   1. First bullish monthly cross on Chainlink's history MACD   2. Bullish bar pattern fractal mirror   3. Lower high candle structure the weekly   4. Break of downtrend resistance on the LINK/BTC   5. 518 days of accumulation"

This is the zone we see after a bearish cycle and BEFORE a new bullish cycle.   Chainlink can be very ""wicky"", and often the price will go JUST UNDER/OVER the resistance zone, or JUST UNDER/OVER the support zone. This makes it hard to give precise entry points. Working within ranges and choosing the lower part of the range is the safest best to protect against those ugly wicks.   Here are some easy setups that guarantee profits during the next bullish cycle - but you will have to have packed-bags in order to bag-in on profits!   _______________________   Follow us here on TradingView for daily updates and trade ideas on crypto , stocks and commodities Hit like & Follow    We thank you for your support !

Analyzing a 4H time frame, I have spotted a rising wedge pattern.   Its support breakout can be an important sign of strength of the sellers.

As predicted by Karina last weekend, the price of gold has successfully reached its target of $1970 and continues to rise. Currently, gold is continuing to increase in value and temporarily closing its trading at an impressive $1980, a very round number.   It can be seen that conflicts in the Middle East are ongoing and escalating, along with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressing support for interest rate stability in his speech on Thursday, making gold more attractive than ever.   Investors are continuously buying gold as a safe haven amidst the current market instability, pushing the price of gold to its highest level in two weeks.   Regarding the future price of gold, Karina maintains her stance on the upward trend as the two peaks (resistance levels) marked on the chart have been conquered. The current target is aiming for a high of $2015. Additionally, the EMA signal still supports the upward momentum, further affirming this breakthrough rise in gold."
2023-10-22 09:00:38,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BTCUSDT/KemCfQQQ-BTC-USDT-I-AM-STILL-STICKING-TO-THIS-IDEA/,"BEARISH Analysis of the Chart: BEARISH BEARISH BEARISH... OUR PREDICTION IS STILL IN PLAY.   I will quit it when we break the previous high of 32K.   But here is why I am bearish...   The 20-day moving average (MA), represented by the red line, is currently below both the 50-day MA (yellow line) and the 150-day MA (sky blue line). This pattern typically indicates a bearish signal, as the short-term MA is lower than the longer-term MAs. Additionally, the prices are currently below recent averages, which suggests a possible downtrend.   While the 20 MA and the 50 MA show a slight convergence, it's important to note that the 20 MA has not yet crossed above the 50 MA. This reinforces the bearish outlook.   Heikin Ashi candles:   The Heikin Ashi method provides a smoother chart that filters out market noise. In this method, green candles indicate buying momentum, while red candles indicate selling momentum. Although there are a few green candles present, they are followed by red candles, suggesting a possible reversal from a bullish to bearish trend.   Market Structure:   When we look at the chart, it is evident that Bitcoin is forming a pattern of lower highs (LH) and higher lows (HL), creating a wedge or triangle shape. While these patterns can break out in either direction, considering other indicators and the prevailing bearish sentiment, it seems more likely for Bitcoin to break downwards.   SMART MONEY CONCEPT Indicators:   When analyzing market trends, it's important to pay attention to various indicators such as ""ChCH"" and ""EQ."" These indicators can help identify shifts in price action and equilibrium zones. If multiple ""ChCH"" labels are present, it may indicate a significant change in market character, potentially suggesting indecision and a possible bearish trend when considering other factors.   Strong Low Zone:   On the right side of the chart, there is a zone labeled as ""Strong Low."" This area has historically shown support, with buyers entering the market. If the price approaches and breaks below this level, it would confirm the prevailing bearish sentiment.   Conclusion:   RephraseAfter analyzing the moving averages, Heikin Ashi candle trends, and market structure, it is clear that the market is showing a bearish bias in the near term. There is a noticeable tension between buyers and sellers, with sellers appearing to have an advantage."

And this would be the optimistic viewpoint that there's a big bull to come after a full correction."

This time we are looking at a long-term (weekly) timefreame.   A major bearish bias is pretty obvious on the left side of the chart, steep down until June 2022.   From June 2022 through June 2023 we have one final bearish wave but not as steep as in early 2022, this with decreasing volume with the exception of the Nov '22 through Feb '23 when a bullish wave took place, at this time we can see a volume increase.   I mention the volume because we can spot a dynamic of decreasing volume as prices are sideways or going down, while volume increases when prices are bullish/going up; telling us that the bulls have been preparing behind the scenes.   Fast forward to August 2023 and we are now in a clear bullish phase, with the current action being a flag/consolidation pattern.   As prices trade weekly above EMA50/21/10, we can expect additional growth and since this is a long-term chart, we can expect this growth long-term.   By growth I simply mean higher highs and higher lows.    200% & 300% targets can be found mapped on the chart.   Wishing you a lovely Sunday.   Thanks a lot for your continued support.   Namaste."
