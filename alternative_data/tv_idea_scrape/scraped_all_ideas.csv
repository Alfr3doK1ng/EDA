A clear break from the highs but it's overlooked because ""Bears are always wrong"" (Etc etc).   2 - The crash. Obvious failure of the uptrend. Unfortunately, this is when people often want to get all in because ""It always goes back up"" (Etc etc).   3 - The big trap. Usually a rally of somewhere in the 100% range which makes everyone think the new bull run is starting.   4 - The crush and re-crush. The new bull trap fails and sets up a prolonged downtrend.   Here are some forecasts very few people seem to have on their radar right now.   1 - BTC is making a high at 30K.  31K will not be broken. We will not see BTC over 31K any time in the coming years. Yes - I said years.   2 - The next big drop will take us to about 17K BTC.   3 - After a bull trap we'll be in a consistent downtrend.   4 - Over the next 3-4 years BTC will trade under 10K. Probably close to 6K.   And this would complete the 2021 forecast."

While next week's economic reports hold the potential to sway XAU/USD's trajectory with high-impact data releases, investors may well keep a watchful eye on the headlines surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict.   The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has surged above 70, signaling overbought technical conditions for gold for the first time since March. In the event of a technical correction for XAU/USD, $1,960 (representing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the latest uptrend) stands as the initial support, followed by the $1,930-$1,920 range (comprising the 200-day Simple Moving Average and 100-day SMA). A daily close below this support could dampen buyer sentiment, potentially ushering in a more extensive price drop towards $1,900 USD (the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and a significant psychological level).   Conversely, in the upward trajectory, gold may encounter robust resistance at $2,000 USD, a formidable psychological and static level. If XAU/USD manages to surpass this threshold, technical buyers might step in to fuel further gains, targeting levels of $2,020 USD and $2,040 USD, both significant static milestones."

The precious metal is now eyeing a return to this year's peak as concerns over an expanding Middle East conflict persist due to the Israel-Palestine tensions. The 10-year US Treasury bond yields have surged to multi-year highs at 5%, amid expectations of stronger US economic data set to be released this week.   Investors are closely monitoring the growth pace from July to September, which will set the stage for year-end interest rates. Optimistic growth rates will demonstrate a robust labor market, strong consumer spending, and economic recovery, despite the tightening monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Gold has rebounded after a correction, nearing $1,970.00, with expectations of reclaiming the year's high near $2,000.00. The precious metal has seen significant gains in the past two weeks. A rising price trend, represented by the 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), provides an advantage moving forward.

The main idea behind my bearish bias was the fact that BTC reversed from the top resistance of the parallel channel. That, combined with pre-halving years being 50/50 green and red, made me think there was more in it for the bears.   However, I always wrote that a bullish break out through the top resistance would be an indication of strength, hence the switch to a more bullish outlook.   For now, the 2023 top of 31.800 is the target to beat (yellow). A push through there could result in a new prolonged bullish trend towards the 40k area or even higher.

Of course things are looking bullish for Monday, ES1!, NQ1!, SPY and QQQ. But watch that little red box because we really shouldn't theoretically surpass it unless ES1! wants to be super messy this week.   Hitting that target box will also be taking out the monthly lows on ES1!, especially if we traverse right to the bottom of it.   Anyway, those are my thoughts on ES1!.

Secondly, if are seeing the formation of a base in the level between 1.05-1.06.

On Tuesday, the data from the US showed that consumer activity remained healthy, with Retail Sales rising by 0.7% on a monthly basis in September. This data failed to trigger a noticeable market reaction, allowing XAU/USD to end the day virtually unchanged.   Next week   The US economic calendar will feature several high-impact data releases next week, starting with the S&P Global Manufacturing and Services PMI surveys on Tuesday. On Thursday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will release the first estimate of the third quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and publish the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Feds preferred gauge of inflation, on Friday.   The market reaction is likely to be straightforward to these data and remain short-lived. A strong Q3 GDP growth could reaffirm the Feds view that the US economy remains resilient despite high interest rates and help the USD gather strength. On the other hand, a soft monthly Core PCE inflation, at or below 0.3%, could support the view that the Fed doesnt need to tighten the policy further this year and weigh on the USD.   Geopolitics are likely to remain as the primary driver of Golds action next week. The Israeli defense minister reportedly ordered troops to prepare to see Gaza ""from the inside."" A ground invasion is likely to trigger another bout of flight to safety and support Gold. A de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East seems very unlikely in the near term, especially with Hezbollah getting more involved in the conflict."

Following a period of reclaiming demand and undergoing consolidation, APT triumphantly breached the Descending channel, marked by substantial volume and a notable ascent.    Currently, after a valid retesting phase, APT is advancing upwards, only to face stern resistance at a supply zone, leading to a significant rebuff. Now, APT is retracing its steps to the Demand area, gearing up for renewed momentum to challenge and potentially break through the Supply barrier.    In this critical phase of the demand, it's imperative for APT to rally or form bullish rejection candles to sustain its upward trajectory and attempt a decisive breach of the supply constraints. If it manages to conquer the $6.33 supply frontier and secures a foothold above, APT probability could smoothly continue its bullish journey, reaching the anticipated bearish OB target zone.    Conversely, should APT falter and fail to garner support at the demand junction, it risks forfeiting its stance and breaking lower. Under such circumstances, APT would be primed for a bearish turn, descending towards the support zone, and potentially retreating further to the foundational key support area."

World gold price stood at 1,976 USD/ounce, a slight increase of 10 USD/ounce compared to the same hour yesterday morning. The precious metal has risen about 9% over the past two weeks as investors seek to hedge against the risk of a broader escalation in the Israel-Hamas war.   Gold tries to break the 2,000 USD/oz level. but could not maintain the upward momentum due to the ongoing Middle East crisis. The rally was fueled by haven buyers pushing prices up. Gold is currently consolidating around $1,980/oz and could test resistance in the coming days despite rising US Treasury yields.   US Treasury yields rose despite conflict in the Middle East, as sellers maintained control of the market. The US national debt exceeds $33 trillion and rising interest rates increase borrowing costs.

The S&P 500 peaked in late July right when many mega-cap tech stocks reported second-quarter earnings results. The AI-fueled rally that gave equities legs following the SVB crisis in mid-March finally lost steam.   The S&P 500 is now a stone's throw away from ""correction territory"" off the 4607 rebound peak a few months ago. The psychological level to watch is 4146 (-10%). As of this writing, equity futures point to an SPX near 4200 - below its rising 200-day moving average and testing the breakout point from late May. What could surprise some bulls would be a break under 4200 followed by a snapback higher.   All eyes are on the VIX. Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" has jumped to 23 this morning. While not screaming panic, the Volatility Index is at its loftiest level since March. The Q3 high of 31 could be in play, but I also notice that a series of lower highs has been the trend since way back in January of 2022 (39). Thus, it's reasonable to assert that the high 20s on the VIX could be the peak this go around. Of course, bullish stock seasonality really takes hold following this week (though pre-election years tend to see somewhat weaker Novembers compared to all years)."

Then the drop can come.   Now, we can be wrong, but we can say with confidence that the next stop is not a new all-time high. I'm saying the same as I have been saying for months. A pop up to 32k+, then back to 21-25k. Personally I think it's 21.   My sell order (I am long cash) is still in at 32k+, and I will replace this and my other sale at < 25k.   We are BULLISH in BTC long-term, just not from here. I may have mentioned this before, like 100 times.   There you go. Take care.

2023-10-24 12:07:40,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BTCUSD/3pcypH1J-Buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact/,"In a wild sequence of events, we saw the number of Bitcoin addresses (with holdings exceeding 100 BTC) soar last week, followed by the announcement of fake news and the breakout above $30,000. But as if this was not enough, Bitcoin did not stop there, and euphoria around Bitcoin Spot ETF approval caused it to spike almost as high as $36,000 overnight. While these events are bullish in nature, we want to reiterate that the price behavior and movements across Bitcoin addresses are very reminiscent of the period leading to new highs in April 2023 and July 2023 (with big players unloading their holdings once new highs were constituted). Due to that and news combined with emotions seemingly driving the market, we feel uneasy about the current rally and the prospects of its sustainability.   Therefore, to confirm that this whole sequence of events was not merely buy the rumor, sell the fact (and the ultimate trap for bulls), we would like to see Bitcoin defend the ground above $32,000 (and, ideally, close above this price tag for multiple consecutive days). Contrarily, to spark fears about impending reversal, we would want to see Bitcoin drop below $32,000, accompanied by a drop in the number of Bitcoin addresses with balances exceeding 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC. As for our stance, we continue to think it is proper to stay on the sidelines for a while longer (ideally until the emotional whipsaws start fading); we do not see the need to chase the market.   Illustration 1.01   Illustration 1.01 shows the 1-minute chart of BTCUSD. It can be observed that in merely four minutes, Bitcoin managed to jump more than $2,000. Again, we want to draw attention to how similar these 1-minute spikes are to the ones we showed earlier this year (leading to peaks in April 2023 and July 2023).   Illustration 1.02   Illustration 1.02 displays the daily chart of BTC.D (Bitcoins market dominance).

2023-10-24 10:24:37,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/APEUSDT/oJuKVKhO-APE-Falling-Wedge-Oversold-Massive-Potential/,"APE has been one of the weakest big tokens of this year, falling over 60% from the January 1st value.   However, there's some light at the end of this dark tunnel. A falling wedge pattern has emerged on the weekly chart, as well as the fact that the weekly RSI has hit oversold levels for the first time in the (Binance) history of this token.   This trade is risky, because the break out has not yet been confirmed. However, I think it's worth the risk because this token has been losing all year and is due to a bounce. A more defensive strategy would be to wait for a break out of the falling wedge."

If the conflict in the Middle East escalates, gold will move higher. On the contrary, if the situation shows signs of calming down, gold will decrease. However, still leaning towards an increase scenario this week.   We see that gold prices will increase more in the near future because gold continues to be a safe haven from developments in the Middle East. The gold market is reacting correctly to new developments in the conflict.   However, gold prices will be difficult to predict from now until the end of the week. The precious metal can quickly soar to 2,000 USD/ounce and then fall to 1,950 USD/ounce due to investors' profit-taking mentality. Gold has increased so quickly in the past 2 weeks. Therefore, a profit-taking phase may be triggered this week."

The ideas on Tradingview talk for a 30-40% correction as does much of social media. Popular cypto Youtube channels share a similar narrative. Terrific stuff.   As a contrarian my opinion is very different from the crowd. Whether that be stocks or crypto. Am certainly walking in the opposite direction from everyone else.   The above 4-day is chart is the Crypto market total without Bitcoin. Some highlights:   1) Price action has broken out of a 2-year resistance trend line.   2) The resistance has now confirmed as support.   3) The green line. This is the GRM. The Golden Ratio Multiplier. When price action closes candle bodies above here, big moves will follow. Just as candle bodies first closed under the GRM back in April 2022. Look left. Big moves come next.   5) The 10x comes from the the wedge breakout. The flag pole is used to measure the market top following a break of past resistance when the 2021 bull market began.   A word of warning. The uptrend will not be equal across all alt-tokens, I'm quite certain of that. Throwing a wide net out across the market will not work as in 2017, you've got to be selective.

Also, the fluctuation of the moving average 50 above the current resistance confirms that trading is being held within the downward path, so we will remain waiting for the price to accumulate additional negative momentum to enable it to form strong bearish waves through which it will target the level of 14582, reaching towards 14500, and by covering it, it will reach 14378. taking into account that stabilized above 14822 will end the bullish attempts.

Let's recap the market from last week and discuss our new plans for the upcoming week, shall we?   Overall, the downward trend of EURUSD continued last week. The strong support level at 1.067 couldn't make the EU turn around, and the downward trend persisted. Currently, EU has temporarily halted trading activities and reached a level of 1.059. The trend from last week was mostly sideways as the price faced a strong support level at 1.054 (as shown on the 1d chart).   However, investors still lack the motivation to push the price back up. With the current trend, there is a possibility of a price increase next week, but it may not last long as it approaches the resistance level.

This currency pair broke through the downward trendline and climbed to 1.0676, the highest level in a month. The outlook for the euro remains favorable before the Asian trading session, although some consolidation may occur after the 100-pip increase.   The sharp decline of the US dollar propelled the EUR/USD pair on Monday. The yield on US 10-year Treasury bonds initially rose above 5.00% but quickly reversed, dropping sharply to 4.84%. This significant decline pushed the US dollar index down to 105.51, the lowest level of the day since September 22. Stock prices on Wall Street showed mixed movements as the lower yields somewhat improved market sentiment.   Volatility continues to dominate the bond market ahead of key issuance events. On Tuesday, PMI data for the Eurozone and the United States are expected to be released. There is a slight improvement in Eurozone sentiment and a slight decrease in the US. The European Central Bank (ECB) will hold its monetary policy meeting on Thursday, along with important US economic indicators such as GDP and the preferred inflation measure of the Federal Reserve."

The upward momentum has increased, albeit not by much. Today, GBP may test the level of 1.2290 before the risk of a pullback increases. The highest expected level around mid-October, near 1.2340, is unlikely to materialize. Support stands at 1.2225, followed by 1.2200.   After dropping to a low of 1.2093 last week, GBP has rebounded and reached a high of 1.2258 yesterday. The upward momentum seems to be forming, and GBP may rise to the level of 1.2340 in the coming days. At this stage, the likelihood of GBP breaking clearly above this level is not high. On the other hand, if GBP breaks the strong support level at 1.2165, it would mean that it will be difficult for it to rise to 1.2340."

After unfolding the trend based fib extension grid, we can see that the important support is the zone from $31,060 to $29,888, to which we can probably see a price reversal in the event of a correction, and then we have support at $28,406.   Looking the other way, we can see that the price is fighting a very strong resistance zone from $33,267 to $35,698, only when it comes out on top and tests positively will we be able to see a path towards $40,000.   Please look at the STOCH indicator, which shows that the energy is moving above the upper limit, which may also result in a price recovery."

In this scenario I think that Ethereum price will try to go at least up to 1900 level and maybe even higher. If ETH price will hold above 1815-1840 resistane area then the next target is 1915-1940 resistane area and I think that there is a good chance that ETH price at least  will touch lower boundary of that area.   One thing to consider is the possibilty of the correction. After such pump it's normal to expect some correction and I think that Ethereum can drop up to 1770 price in this correction phase.   Otherwise Ethereum looks bullish and I don't expect any significant drops unless Bitcoin will drop heavily.   Please, do not forget to boost this idea & share it with your friends; thanks."

In recent days, the USD has been weakening and strengthening the EUR significantly. Let's delve deeper into this currency with Karina!   The USD has declined against other currencies in the recent trading session, following the decrease in the US Treasury's interest rates, as traders anticipate new economic data from the US later this week.   Previously, the interest rates of US Treasury bonds had surged since mid-July, contributing to the attractiveness of the USD and helping the DXY index increase by over 6%. However, this index has shown little volatility since the beginning of October. ""It is surprising that both the sell-off of long-term bonds and the situation in the Middle East, as well as the safe-haven asset status, are unable to continue driving the USD.""   The depreciation of the USD has greatly benefited the EUR/USD, causing it to rise in value. Currently, the EUR/USD is trading at 0.0684, marking a 0.15% increase for the day. The short-term upward trend is indicated on the 4-hour time frame, and if the EUR/USD maintains its momentum, it may reach resistance at a high level according to Fibonacci retracement levels at 1.080."

Even though it's not a Golden Cross, on the 1W time-frame it attracts particular importance as the last time we saw this bullish signal was more than 13 years ago (February 08 2010) in the (sharp) recovery process after the 2008 Housing Crisis.   The fractals of that Crisis and the (current) 2022 Inflation Crisis are similar. Both hit the 0.9 Fibonacci retracement level and got the first major rejection since the Bear Market. The current wave is ongoing but in 2010 it approached the 0.618 Fib and rebounded strongly for nearly 1 year. On the current pull-back wave the 0.618 Fib is at 14000 and thi index already hit 14420.   Is it good enough to start the new recovery wave? It certainly is low enough to give us acceptable risk for the long-term, especially after the formation of a 13 year old bullish pattern. Based on the 2010 fractal, we may see new All Time Highs on Nasdaq in less than 6 months.

Gold prices today continue to trade quietly with minimal fluctuations, as this precious metal remains sideways around the $1975 range, and there is still limited information regarding future trends.   However, it is not because the upward momentum of gold has ceased, but rather the market needs to consolidate above the resistance level of $1985 per ounce. The psychological level of $2000 per ounce is crucial, especially for short-term traders, so gold may experience a slight decline before resuming its upward trend.   According to Karina, a potential decline could occur near the initial support level around $1950 per ounce, followed by $1920 per ounce. Gold has experienced rapid gains over the past two weeks, so a profit-taking phase may be activated this week. What are your thoughts? Do you think gold will rise or fall?"

The unemployment rate for August measured 4.2%, a slight drop from estimates and the prior print of 4.3%.   The UK has experienced a notable easing in the job market  one of the telling signs that restrictive monetary policy is having an effect on the real economy. Central banks are broadly in agreement that a period of below trend growth and easing in the job market is required to bring inflation back towards target. The slight turn lower will not force the Bank of England to seek higher interest rates as inflation has broadly been heading lower and effects of higher rates are being felt across the board.   GBPUSD   decline has paused near the March low of 1.1800, a significant support level. With oversold conditions and light positioning, a small rebound could occur. Breaking above the initial resistance at 1.2350 may lead to a potential rise towards the 200-day moving average around 1.2450. Considering the retreat from the 200-week moving average in July and the subsequent sharp decline, there is a higher chance that the current retracement is a correction of last year's rally."

At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market is currently trading around $34,000, reflecting a 20% increase over the past seven days. The strong upward trend is reinforced by consistent trading activity on a daily basis.

This has contributed to an even hotter market than ever before. It is expected that this price surge will reach $40,019. What are your thoughts on this matter? Do you agree with me?"

2023-10-24 10:28:25,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/XAUUSD/DSEWHP53-Gold-will-pull-back-again/,"Dear friends, At the end of yesterday's trading session, gold dropped by tens of dollars after reaching the $2,000 per ounce threshold in the previous weekend's trading session. This comes as the market expects the military conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East to not escalate, as Israel continues to postpone a ground attack on Gaza in hopes that Hamas will release more hostages.   Reasons and expectations for gold in the near future:   - International financial institutions have started reducing the demand for safe-haven assets in favor of precious metals. The decrease in the price of gold today is understandable.   - In the coming days, the European Central Bank (ECB) will decide on monetary policy, while the US will announce the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index for September, which is a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve. This information could cause fluctuations in the value of the USD, impacting the trend of global gold prices.   Regarding technical analysis:   In the short term, I still maintain the view that the $2000 mark holds significant psychological importance, so gold is expected to slightly drop to support levels around $1950 before continuing its upward trajectory.   In the long term, I believe that the $2065 mark will be the next milestone for this precious metal as the Gold market is hotter than ever. What are your thoughts on this?"

2023-10-24 20:36:45,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/LINKUSD/O4pENkEx-Cryptographic-Truth-Part-2-Chainlink/,"Part 1   The bar pattern continues to play out like clockwork, but for how long? There comes a time when every bar pattern decouples and fails to mirror. One of the most amazing bar patterns I followed was in 2022, where a distribution bear market fractal from 2018 started forming at all-time highs for Bitcoin.   For the next 218 days, this bar pattern mirrored 2018. It was mind-blowing, also the easiest trading year by far. The TA below was published at the start of 2022, so we knew how the whole year would play out with incredible accuracy.   The key to finding out where the top will be is within Bitcoin; almost every big move Chainlink has made last cycle has been followed by a large Bitcoin move as well.   So if we go back to the very first time Chainlink broke a massive range, we can see Bitcoin had a massive move up in 2019.   This right here is the only move where Chainlink moved up without Bitcoin, and it only managed half its impulse wave before Bitcoin moved up.   It's the only time in history so far.   The next and last range break was again followed by a Bitcoin move, and the final push to Chainlink's all-time high to blow off top was followed by Bitcoin moves.   So once the range breaks, Chainlink has a very distinct pattern, as you can see in the chart below; it's always the same:   One impulse up   One Pullback   One impulse up   That's it; then the move is over. It happens very quickly. You can see there the two times it's happened outside of a bull market. It took 40-50 days. 2021 took double, most likely because we were in a bull market. We are definitely not in a bull market, so expect the move to last around 50 days.   Let's take a look at what happened in the Bull market. Chainlink already made a run from 10 dollars up to 53 dollars; we are at 10 dollars right now.   2021   Bitcoin - 23,500   Chainlink - 10 dollars   2023   Bitcoin - $30,600   Chainlink - 10 dollars   The difference is massive from 2021 to 2023, but regardless, both assets ended up hitting the golden pocket at the same time in 52 days! Amazing stuff really; both are much more in sync than I ever expected!   So if we take the bar pattern (BTC) of the cycle low in 2015 and overlay it on today's price action, we get the following.   Pretty close mirror, especially the first cycle bottom in June 2022. So if we look at what fib level that was in 2015, we can see Bitcoin topped out just under the golden pocket.   Now, if we go back to the comparison chart of BTC and LINK, we can see that if Bitcoin did, in fact, top out under the golden pocket, that would then put LINK at $25.   So if we take a look at the macro and range Fib retracements, we can see that the 4.236 range retracement for LINK comes in at $25.   Everything you've seen in this TA is how I arrived at the most probable outcome for Chainlink this year for . This TA can change very quickly depending on what level Bitcoin is at, so it's basically near impossible to predict where it will top. As new data comes in, we will change targets, so don't take this to the bank. One thing is for sure, the bar pattern will guide the way.   The main thing we need to focus on here is the first pullback in this zigzag fractal. Where it pulls back will give us a massive clue on where it tops.   Now I want to finish off by adding a crazy outcome for LINK. This has a low chance of playing out, in my opinion, but anything is possible. So instead of LINK topping out at $200 in October 2025, it tops out at $750. This would basically be a mirror move from 2019 in terms of fib levels. Highly unlikely, heck if we made a 100% retracement by mid-November, it would be possible."

Besides strong Selling Intra-day impulse, Gold found Buyers near #1,960s many times which represents Higher Highs Lower zone where Institutional capital flew from Gold and Investors offloaded their Short-term Selling orders (as I announced many times), pushing Price-action once again towards #1,980s, former multi-Month Resistance level. Constant Hourly 4 charts Bullish spikes and Bullish move in general has no further room to go, so I don't expect this consolidation to continue for more than #2 sessions. My focus shifts to Gold ties with Bond Yields and DX, where Gold is attempting to find a equilibrium between the two. This indeed is not a good sign for those who want to Buy this market (most of Traders will) as the more prominent area for Buyers to arise is likely around Hourly 4 charts #1,952.80 - #1,963.80 which is crucial re-Buy zone to rely on, having seen how well it held Price-action Lower or Higher in the past few weeks (current fractal). This is a cautious market at the moment. As Buying seems limited in most cases, I am still waiting for Selling confirmation (once again) as I am without order for the past few sessions.   My position:   It is indeed clash between Sellers expecting a correction with Buyers who rely on Fundamental side which if happens points on more gains on Gold. Buying can only continue if Fundamental side prevails (with more crisis escalation news) however if those do not appear, I will be ready to Sell Gold on Spot towards #1,952.80 benchmark first then later on Lower levels on Gold.

One Love,   The FXPROFESSOR    * The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a U.S. financial services company that provides clearing and settlement services for financial markets. When the iShares Bitcoin Trust is listed on the DTCC, it indicates that the trust's trades can now be cleared and settled through this well-established financial institution. This is big because it provides an extra layer of security and legitimacy to trading the asset.   The listing on DTCC is often considered a step toward getting an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) approved. ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, and they can make it easier for retail and institutional investors to invest in assets like Bitcoin without actually holding the cryptocurrency themselves.   So, when you hear that the iShares Bitcoin Trust got listed on DTCC, it suggests that an ETF approval could be just around the corner. This would be a huge deal for Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole, likely bringing in more liquidity and potentially pushing up prices.   twitter link:   x.com/EricBalch...529570759704832?s=20"

The rally was fueled by slower inflation and hype over artificial intelligence.   But more recently, the Federal Reserve's unwavering higher-for-longer rate stance and a deepening bond-market rout have had a sobering effect on equities sentiment, with the S&P 500 index halving its year-to-date gains.   Indeed stock valuations are looking increasingly stretched, raising the risk of a correction.   One such indicator in particular is flashing   RED   - the relative valuation of stocks versus the debt market.   SPX / ICE BofA Corporate Total Return Index   In August this year, the S&P 500   SPX   climbed to levels last seen during the peak of dot-com boom, relative to an index that tracks the US corporate bond market.   The gauge is still holding near those highs, despite the recent pullback in equities.   The metric last surged this high in the spring of 2000  and that was followed by a multi-year meltdown in stocks that saw the S&P 500 crash 50% between March 2000 and October 2002.   SPX 50% Decline During 2000-2002   Another indicator that shows the richness of stocks relative to debt is the so-called equity risk premium  or the extra return on shares over government debt, which is considered a safer form of investment. The metric has plunged this year lows unseen in decades, indicating elevated stock valuations.   ""Equity risk premium is near its worst ever level going back to 1927. In the 6 instances this has occurred, the markets saw a major correction & recession/depression - 1929, 1969, 99/00, 07, 18/19, present,"" research firm MacroEdge said in a   recent post on X   (ex-Twitter).   The so-called equity risk premium (earnings yield minus bond yield) recently fell to a new cycle low and remains well below historical averages. In other words, the stock market has become more expensive relative to the bond market despite the recent pullback.   Meanwhile the main graph (quarterly Div-adjusted chart for   TLT   20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) illustrates perhaps right there could the end for U.S. Govt Bond Market decline, with Double top as a further projected/ targeted upside price action.   Will all of that bring U.S. stock market to 50% decline like in early 2000s!?   Time will show!"

So cash in when Bitcoin reaches this price. And same for the other cryptos that you hold. The month October and maybe November will be nice, but December is known as a red month. From 3rd of January all prices will start to increase again.   Bitcoin spot ETF will not be earlier than 10th of January 2024."

As we saw last week, GBPUSD didn't experience much change in trading. The price remained sideways within a narrow range, and no significant breakthrough occurred.   This week, GBPUSD started the session by maintaining its previous trading level at 1.2155. However, it is expected to be an eventful week as news continues to be released from October 24th to October 27th. If the news is positive, it is likely that the resistance level at 1.23 will be easily surpassed. On the other hand, if GBPUSD fails to hold its current stability below the support level of 1.205, that will be the target.   What are your thoughts on the upcoming moves of GBPUSD?"

At the time of writing this article, the British Pound currency is trading at a level of 1.2270. The upward trend is very strong due to support from the adjustment of the US Dollar (USD), along with improved risk sentiment.

Litecoin has a number of similarities to Bitcoin, but there are also some key differences. Litecoin has a faster block generation rate (2.5 minutes versus 10 minutes for Bitcoin), which means that transactions are confirmed more quickly. Litecoin also has a larger maximum supply (84 million coins versus 21 million for Bitcoin).   Litecoin has been gaining popularity in recent years, due in part to its faster transaction times and lower fees. Litecoin is also one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, supported by a wide range of exchanges and merchants.   **Recent news**   * On October 22, 2023, Litecoin Foundation announced a partnership with Mastercard to enable Litecoin payments at over 80 million merchants worldwide.   * On October 21, 2023, Litecoin Core 0.21.2 was released, which includes a number of bug fixes and performance improvements.   * On October 20, 2023, Litecoin Foundation announced a $1 million grant program to support Litecoin development and adoption.   **Disclaimer**   I am not a financial advisor, and this should not be taken as financial advice.

TOday gold tested the strond 1953 resistance zone and gave a strong rejection around 220pips. In the higher timeframe gold is moving between a Chanel wich tested support 3times. Also a bullish flagpattern is forming wich indicated a posible bullish breakout.   Either gold will break out in short notice. Or gold will fall again toward 1953-1950 and then reject this resistance to the upside and breaks out to the upside testing the strong 1983-1985 resistance.

One Love,   The FXPROFESSOR    Historical Proof (click on play):   Full video transcript:   00:08 Hi everyone, just a quick one today because everyone else is asking Professor, what do you see next? What do you think about the crypto market?   00:15 So, without further ado, First of all, last big entry we had October 20th. I posted for my friends and followers that today is the day to go long on alts and that was for a very specific bunch of reasons that I will explain.   00:32 Obviously, we are happy to hear from you. Happy bunnies right now taking profit. Well, I did take some profits at 31, but I increased my positions over 31,500 and I will explain to you why.   00:45 So without further ado, let's get to it. First, we had this fake news from Cointelegraph saying that ETF is approved.   00:54 The price came under this support level over here, what you see as the yellow level. So that level was tested again.   01:03 And a third test we said is going to be imminent and it will be the decisive one. And I gave 60% and it will go higher.   03:01 So, one, two, three, boom. Now, where do we stand at this moment? Well, we are over this cluster of resistances, so right now we do have support over here, let's make this white so everyone can be clear about this, so we have support at 31.   03:29 500 as well as the 3107c, great news and the market breaks out and goes faster and higher. So remember the one, two, three breakouts on the 50-minute chart.   04:40 Let's go on the four-hour chart. We have a one, two, three breakout and you see the minute it breaks over that level things become faster.   04:49 Now, let's go back in time and see what can happen from here. In a similar manner, one, two, three breakout back in January 12th.   05:01 You all know how Tradingview works and why I'm here and why I enjoy it so much because once you post something, it stays forever.   05:08 The only thing you can do is edit it for 50 minutes. After that, you can't do anything. So let's click on play and see what happened over here at this breakout which again was one, two, three, check out support.   05:21 And ready to fly. Did it fly? Let's click on play and we will find out. So let's go. Boom. You see what happens?   05:32 The price just explodes upwards. And that's the breakout from $80. $18,017, $18,018 and it's going all the way up to $24,000.   05:44 Okay? And of course, after that, it goes even higher. So, where do we have right now? What do we have?   05:51 We have a massive breakout on the $1,200. And my expectation is to see that level up there and it could be fast.   05:59 That's an ascending line. What I call the resistance before halving. I have posted a few ideas about this, but the level that we are looking at is this resistance over here, support over here.   06:26 Breakout breakdown over here. So these levels I expect it to be checked as a resistance. Okay, and it could be fast.   06:36 Let's go back to the one hour chart. I have gi- even a 55% that the breakout will happen for a variety of reasons.   07:34 Okay, also remember we had the ETF 31,500 is now support. This is the third and decisive attempt and the breakout.   07:46 Okay. So that's the target up there. It's lying between 44,800, around 45,000. Okay. 44,000, 45,000. Now for those who are late into this trade, I think the best you can expect is.   08:18 And the text I wish. A retracement where will you be able to buy at the levels 33,655, 32,826 and of course the big one which is now 31,600, okay?   11:01 So my Fibonacci which is what I do behind the scenes before I show you levels is this, I'm gonna leave these levels on and of course What I see is the interim big resistance at 37,585, so at this stage I have alerts for all these which go to automatically to my subscribers, and of course I will keep   12:22 you posted with new charts, but remember, we're in a super bullish scenario, we have seen this before, okay, you can check the charts, so I'm gonna be posting this old chart from January 12th because last night we were here and boom, this is what happens in these kind of cases.   12:42 Take care, keep in touch."

If they try to go higher, then next week, may begin to grow in the region of 40000-41000$ like says the yellow fractal   If the price fails to break above 31000$, then we will see a correction to the $24,000 area according to the green fractal.   Next week, 03.05.2023, the FOMC meeting and the announcement of the new Fed rate. This event will definitely add fuel to the fire.   At the end of last year,   we published an idea where we demonstrated our thoughts and calculations on when the crypto market could peak   Today, we've ""played"" around with the Gunn box and possible price movement fractals.   The Gann Box is stretched from Dec. 2018 low to the probable high in October 2025.   Skeptics will say that this is a bit ""pulled by the ears"", but the proportions of   the Gann box on the global chart show us trend turning points and the beginnings of a strong movement.   You can personally explore this tool, sometimes it can surprise and impress.   The green fractal shows that over the next six months, a long process of capital transfer from Bitcoin to altcoins may take place.   During this period, some altcoins can shoot up quite a bit, let's call this period a mini-alt-season.   Then in October, the price of BTC can shoot up from 30 thousand dollars to 51 thousand dollars   Then a must-have occurs before every ""BTC halving"" - a sharp correction.   After ""BTC halving"" will start a stable and long-term growth trend.   The growth of the BTCUSD price to 275-300 thousand dollars in two years will be a blessing)   What if we witness a miracle and the BTC price crosses the 1million $ mark?   What do you think?

2023-10-24 14:07:59,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BTCUSD/YrxNWuW0-Bitcoin-BTC-Logarithmic-Roadmap/,"Hi Traders, Investors and Speculators of Charts   I love the logarithmic view of BTC. It gives a clearer indication of price increases alongside growth. Although inflation and value factors aren't physically calculated into the price, seeing the upwards curve makes more sense from a ""holistic view"" that would include things such as growth and inflation.   A   logarithmic chart view   displays price changes as a   percentage of the previous price   . This means that equal vertical distances on the chart represent equal percentage changes, regardless of the absolute price level.   This is in contrast to a   regular chart view   , which displays price changes on an arithmetic scale. This means that   equal vertical distances   on the chart   represent equal absolute price changes.   With help of great technical indicators, we can use the logarithmic chart as a sort of ""roadmap"".   The logarithmic trendline indicator (log trend channel) shows possible support and resistance zones. The logarithmic moving averages show possible support zones, and help identify if the price is generally trading bearish (under) or bullish (over).   Logarithmic Moving averages / support zones :   Just for interest sake, I mapped out the date-ranges, as well as how far the price fell logarithmically after each top. You'll see the word   ""clicks""   on the chart. This simply indicates the amount of diagonal trendlines it has fallen. By using this pattern-dedicated approach, a commonality is found which may be useful in speculating a future price. Because if not for past history, how else would we speculate on the future?   It's interesting to note that the past 3 ATH's (all time high's) are each lower than the previous if you compare it not to price but to the ""click lines"". Even the fourth high (the one coming next) will be on a lower click-line than the previous, and that estimate is already over 300k. This is a really helpful way to speculate a future high because usually on a regular-view chart, the zone above the ATH is uncharted territory. You could use a   Fibonacci trend-based extension   , but this is limited to the cycle that you're using for input points. Logarithmic chart + indicators factor in the entire history of the price.   What are your thoughts, do you think 300K is realistic by September 2025?   _______________________   Follow us here on TradingView for daily updates and trade ideas on crypto , stocks and commodities Hit like & Follow    We thank you for your support !

2023-10-24 05:27:11,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/EURUSD/mhA64vmT-EUR-USD-Volatility-Divergence/,"EURUSD   Fundamental Analysis:   the   EUR/USD   currency pair is influenced by diverging economic indicators between the Eurozone and the United States. The U.S. shows stronger economic momentum with a GDP growth rate of 2.1% compared to the Eurozone's 0.1%, and a lower unemployment rate of 3.8% versus 6.4%. Additionally, the U.S. offers a higher interest rate of 5.5%, making dollar assets more attractive, and boasts a consumer confidence level of 63 points, far exceeding the Eurozone's negative -17.8.  the overall data suggests that the U.S. dollar is likely to strengthen against the euro in the short to medium term.   Technical Analysis:   the   EUR/USD   pair is currently consolidating around a strong support zone following a significant bearish trend. This presents two primary scenarios based on potential actions by the European Central Bank (ECB):   Scenario A: If the ECB decides to pause interest rates, we could see the EUR/USD pair decline further, potentially reaching around the 1.04 level. This would be a continuation of the existing bearish sentiment.   Scenario B: On the other hand, if the ECB opts to raise interest rates, this could serve as a catalyst for the pair to start a bullish trend, reversing some of the recent losses.   Scenario C: It's also worth considering that if the ECB pauses rates amidst rising geopolitical tensions, the pair could still experience bullish movements. This could occur if investors start to view the U.S. dollar as less reliable due to uncertainty, thereby increasing demand for the euro.   Bullish Targets :   1.06400, 1.06900   Bearish Target :   1.04   VIX   A. Tighten Risk Management   B. Diversify and Seek Safe Havens   C. Maintain Emotional Discipline   E. Avoid Over Trading   F.

2023-10-23 18:11:27,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/XAUUSD/LSH0l2OC-Gold-Route-Map-UPDATE/,"Hey Everyone,   Please see update on our 1H chart route map for the week.   We saw price retrace into the first stage of our retracement range hitting bearish targets 1979 and 1970 and then bounce off this support at 1970 back into resistance at 1979.   Ema5 failed to cross 1979 and so we saw price retest support at 1970 for another bounce inline with our plans to buy dips.   We will need to see either ema5 to cross below 1970 for a full test into the lower range of the retracement range or a cross and lock above 1979 to confirm the range above.   We are expecting some sideways ranging movement until the breakout.   We had a continuation of the strong move up last week with price finishing off with testing weighted resistance at 1994 and then support at 1979. 1979 has now turned into resistance today.   EMA5 cross above 1994 will open the levels and range above to track and trade or a cross and lock below 1979 will open the retracement range at 1959 -1950 correctional retest zone.   - This range is now open, however a cross and lock below 1970 will confirm the full retracement range gap.   A break below the retracement range will see a test to the swing range for a bounce and a failure to lock below the retracement range will see a bounce up from this level.   We will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch the bounces up.   We will continue to buy dips using our support levels taking 30 to 40 pips. As stated before each of our level structures give 20 to 40 pip bounces, which is enough for a nice entry and exit. If you back test the levels we have shared every week for the last 18 months, you can see how effectively they can be used to trade with or against short term swings and trends.   BULLISH TARGETS   1987   EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 1987 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET   1994   2005   EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 2005 WILL OPEN 2018 AN 2032   BEARISH TARGETS   1979 - DONE   1970 - DONE   EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 1979 WILL OPEN THE RETRACEMENT RANGE   RETRACEMENT RANGE   1959   1950   EMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 1950 WILL OPEN THE SWING RANGE RANGE   SWING RANGE   1913   As always, we will keep you all updated with regular updates throughout the week and how we manage the active ideas and setups.

This projection is based on several key indicators and patterns that have historically proven to be reliable in predicting market movements.   Now, you might wonder what makes November particularly promising for BTC. Well, let me share some insights that have led me to this conclusion:   1.	Institutional Adoption: We've witnessed a surge in institutional investors entering the cryptocurrency space, with many renowned companies allocating significant resources to BTC. This increased interest from institutional players is expected to drive demand and, subsequently, push the price higher.   2.	Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has been overwhelmingly positive, with an increasing number of individuals recognizing its potential as a store of value and hedge against inflation. This growing confidence is likely to attract more investors, contributing to the upward movement of BTC.   3.	Halving Effect: Bitcoin's halving event, which occurred in April 2024, has historically been followed by substantial price rallies. With the halving's impact starting to take effect, we can anticipate a surge in demand, leading to a significant price increase.   Considering these factors, I strongly encourage you to seize this opportunity and consider a long position on Bitcoin. By doing so, you position yourself to potentially benefit from the projected 40% return in November. However, please remember that trading involves risks, and it is essential to conduct your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.   Don't let this opportunity slip away! Take action now and embark on a rewarding journey with Bitcoin. If you have any questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to out by commenting below."

That was also at the bottom of the 14-month Channel Up pattern. With the 1D RSI breaking below the 30.00 oversold barrier on Friday, this is technically the best buy opportunity since the Channel's first Low on October 13 2022.   In fact the two fractals are identical with the 2022 one breaking above the dashed Lower Highs trend-line and hitting the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. As a result, we issue a buy signal on BKNG, targeting 3140 (Fib 0.786) before the year is over.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

We have seen continued NZD weakness over the past few days, with no fundamentals of note for this currency in the week.   Even though I'm noticing USD slow-down, and a likely retracement due to the over-extended current uptrend, I still think this pair will fall as the USD will remain stronger than the USD.   Support seems to have been broken, but I'm monitoring closely as we may retest after an initial drop from here.
