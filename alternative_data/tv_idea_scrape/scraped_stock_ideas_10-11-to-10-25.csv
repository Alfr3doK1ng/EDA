We rose to the $217 area and then started to move back down. If you were following along today, you know that was most likely the a wave and start of b wave. It is possible that was all of iv but doubtful. I expect us to drop to around the $207-$209 area before popping back up for our C wave of iv. If this plays out according, I am going to buy some puts for our wave v of (3) down. If I get the chance, I may buy some calls for this c wave but it depends on my assignment.

2023-10-25 12:55:04,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/SPY/QDLUYScb-Spy/,"Last post I went over the tech sectors mostly to show how they were rolling  over. Fast forward and they are still rolling over  but I think we get a 2-3% pop before we continue that slide.   Here's my reason   IXIC or Nasdaq composite  represents  the entire tech unlike NDX/QQQ which represents  only the top 100.   Late Friday  we flush within 40 points of trendline support  and Close right on top of daily 200ema.   When Monday comes if we open up above 12,900 I want to buy the dip in tech for an anticipated  2% pop in the coming week.   Vix daily chart   Closed outside weekly bollingerband   Closed out side daily bollingerbands  2 days in a row.   This type of overextension is not sustainable  on the vix. Hourly CCI is at levels where you could easily see 20% pullback   Also possible  rising wedge formed   Closed  at .5 or 50% retracement  on fib, which is 21.74  resistance   I'd like to see Vix stay below 22 to be bullish on equities   10yr/TNX   Finished  Thursday  with a hangman on the daily,  followed with more pullback on Friday.   We are about 6% extended from the 21ema. Usually  at between 5-7% extended the 10yr returns back to test the 21ema (White line)   Spy 30 Min chart  I wanted to break down The time frame to show you the price action and pattern that has formed   Remember,  anything that sells off really quick usually  forms a bullish falling wedge and if it rises fast it forms a bearish rising Wedge.   Here you can see the rising wedge formed  that i think will take us back to 428,-430.   There's so much resistance  in that  area that you have to pause on any higher targets until spy closes over 432 again.   1. Fib resistance   2. Price action resistance   3. 20sma and 21ema resistance   U see where I circled? That was a fake breakout when Powell  was speaking Thursday.   The green arrow is where we rejected at  on fridays rebound before flushing to 421.   I know I always go over  how over sold the money flow or MFI is on The ES and NQ but now it's also severely  oversold on SPY 3-4 hour money flow.   The last 3 times spy went this oversold on the 4hour money flow these moves followed within the next 2 trading sessions   March 15th 2023   Spy 384   March 16th - Spy 396   3% pop   Nov 3rd 2022   Spy 369   Nov 4th 2022   Spy 378   2%pop   Sept 27th 2022   Spy 361   Sept 28th 2022   Spy 372   3% pop.

I originally turned bullish on it a bit too early last week, but the chart has become clearer over the past week or so as it hasn't been able to gain any strength.   From here, I think we'll see a capitulation in price over the next week going into the lower support area (buy zone).   From there, I think we'll see a very strong upside move in September that pushes price all the way up to the upper resistance (sell zone).   If you're able to trade it perfectly, it would setup a potential return of somewhere between 2x-3x (hence why I think it's one of the best trades).   Let's see if it plays out."

Some small divergence already starting to show up, despite we are under the meaningful moving averages (9/21/50/52/180/200 day MA's). Likely the huge wave 2 already in, from which we already have a smaller wave 1 up, from which we likely pulled back as a wxy/abc to today's price action.   We are sitting now on a critical level, I could make 2 scenarios for this drawdown cycle, counting either as an impulse, or an overall diagonal for the last wave. This means eather we have bottomed/near bottomed today (tomorrow), OR 1/2 small zigzag swinglow is still arriving, watch around the 9.50-10.00 USD levels.   Below 9.40 the yellow route gaining more momentum.   This now has a huge potential, so worth tracking, risk to reward getting very very good now.

I think my attention was draw to it because it's having a crazy move up, which the daily is demonstrating now.   However, it might get crazier because I have information from my dowsing saying it's going to around $38-39 over the next 3-4 weeks.   Earnings aren't until Nov. 21 (a.m.)   It may be some kind of manipulation or something. I'm thinking of what happened to BBBY.

2023-10-24 14:42:26,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/XLP/wKTcaIMZ-Introduction-to-Relative-Strength-Part-3/,"In parts one and two (linked) we discussed the construction and use of relative strength ratios (RS) in trading and analysis, common errors, and best practice. In part three we look at the consumer discretionary to consumer staples ratio and attempt to draw trading and economic insight from that analysis.   Any method used to analyze a single security price chart can be used to analyze ratios. I tend to use simple methods and I do not require the same precision in terms of retracements and support/resistance that I would use when analyzing or trading a single security.   Consumer Discretionary (XLY) / Consumer Staples (XLP):   I generally think about this ratio in two ways. The first, and for my purposes, the most important, it reflects the markets judgement around the strength of the economy. When the economy is improving, as it has over the last few months, the ratio should weaken (which it has done). This is because as discretionary income rises, confident consumers are more likely to spend on non-essentials or staples. When they are less confident, they spend less on non-essential discretionary and more on staples. It is important to remember that consumption is around 70% of GDP. For economic or macro analysis, I prefer to use monthly perspective charts.   I believe that the long outperformance of discretionary relative to staples is mostly due to the massive liquidity added to the system since the great financial crisis. The liquidity that has aided consumers and thus the economy in general. As liquidity normalizes and the economy slows, staples should begin to outperform discretionary.   The second is creating a tradable spread. Creating proportional spreads (see part two) between two sector ETF's, expressing trades that overweight or underweight specific sectors inside a portfolio, or creating pairs trades using names within the two sectors are all legitimate uses of ratios. When creating pairs trades inside a sector my preference is to use each sectors market largest capitalization names (market generals) as they are less vulnerable to idiosyncratic risk. I also prefer to pair names with similar businesses. For instance, I would not pair Walmart (staples) with Tesla (discretionarily) but would consider Walmart or Costco verses Amazon.   One final thought, profitable spread trades can be structured using either highly positive or negatively correlated pairs. What fails to work consistently are spreads with spurious correlation.   Chart 1 TOP: Monthly Consumer Discretionary (XLY) in ratio to Consumer Staples (XLP): Top Panel: Close line charts for both ETFs.   Since XLY on the left scale trades at over two times the price level of XLP (172 verses 72), XLP has been compressed in order to easily compare the paths of the two symbols. Clearly both staples and discretionary have significant positive long-term correlation as they follow the larger market higher and lower. The high degree of correlation suggests that the two markets can be generally expected to trend together, but at varying rates depending on the consumer/economic outlook.  It is the difference in the rates of change that creates the profit or loss.   Monthly: Technically, the ratio topped in October 2008 and since 2011 has trended lower in a well-defined channel. That channel was broken in March 2022 as inflation exploded higher and the Federal Reserve began to tighten monetary policy (both actions hurt discretionary spending).   Over the last few months, as the outlook improved and the economic narrative changed to soft landing, the ratio has again turned lower and is now testing the area of the broken trendline that defined the broad down sloping channel.   MACD momentum remains on a sell signal.  In this perspective, I view the chart at an important juncture from which a sign of either strength or weakness is likely to define the trend for the next year.   Weekly Detail: Note the narrow Bollinger band and the turn higher over the last few weeks. A break above the lateral resistance coupled with a break of the downtrend would strongly suggest that staples are likely to outperform over coming months.   As a last step, I like to examine the raw bar charts on both sides of the spread. In this case, like the general market, both look weak. Discretionary is retreating from the top of its range while staples are resting at good support. The concern here would be that a breakdown from a long range of distribution would likely generate significant selling and imply significantly lower lows.   Conclusion: I suspect that the spread is in the process of bottoming and that, as the economy weakens over the next few months, staples will outperform. But, overt proof of a turn higher is lacking. While the recent hook higher is promising, it needs to move above the overhead resistance. If it does, odds become very good that the economy is weakening and that staples will enter a significant cycle of outperformance.

On the wider picture of Apple in the last 10 years (1W time-frame), such pull-backs have been nothing more that consolidation phases before the next Expansion (usually 18 month - green arrows) that leads to the eventual peak and a new yearly correction (red arrows).   Those consolidation phases find Support on the 1W MA50 (even the COVID crash broke it just marginally), unlike the yearly corrections which find on the 1W MA200 (orange trend-line). What's astounding is the frequency of the consolidation pull-backs, which can be very effectively displayed with the use of the Sine Waves. As you can see on our chart, in the last 10 years, all pull-backs to the 1W MA50 after a 1W MA200 rebound, are located at the bottom of the Waves.   This indicates that most likely the current one is over and investors are expected to 'ride' the new 18-month Expansion wave to the new All Time High.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ** Please LIKE , FOLLOW , SHARE  and COMMENT  if you enjoy this idea!

It doesn't mean that   GOOG   is headed for a bad report. Rather, retail investors are selling ETFs or moving money out of stocks into safe havens, or other adjustments to portfolios and 401(k)s. The selling dug into the most recent weak support level.   However,   GOOGL   has not sent out any advisor in recent weeks regarding its earnings report. Any company this size, and as a veteran company of the stock market, would warn if earnings were going to miss the retail-side analyst estimates. So this is a sympathy move merely because the retail-side selling is moving big-name companies down at this time.   If it has a great earnings report,   which the previous runs suggest   , then the HFTs may trigger a gap up at open tomorrow. Alphabet had improvement in its quarterly report last quarter. Yearly revenues have been up for 4 years but earnings are up and down as it invests hugely in AI."

2023-10-25 10:53:21,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/x22SJc1v-Day-Trader-s-Toolbox-Part-2-VWAP/,"Welcome to the Day Trader's Toolbox, a 3-Part series focused on enhancing your day trading skills.   In this second instalment, we delve into the intricacies of   VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)   , a versatile indicator that can help you navigate intra-day price action.   I. Understanding VWAP:   What is VWAP?   VWAP calculates the average price at which a security has traded during a specified period, usually a trading day. It is unique in that it combines both price and volume data to provide a weighted average, reflecting not just where a stock has traded but also the volume at each price level.   How to Add VWAP to Your Charts   TradingView make it easy to add VWAP to your charts. Simply type VWAP into the indicators search bar. The VWAP line will appear as a continuous line on your chart, indicating the average price levels for the day. It offers a moving average of the price throughout the day, with the line calculated using intraday price data from the market open to the close.   VWAP is typically viewed on day trading timeframes (5min and 1min candle charts). VWAP resets at the open of each day, for this reason VWAP tends to become more useful as the trading day progresses.   Heres how VWAP typically looks on your intraday price chart:   S&P 500 1min Candle Chart (Daily VWAP)   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   II. 3 Ways to Use VWAP When Day Trading   1. Sentiment Analysis   VWAP is a powerful tool for analysing market sentiment, helping day traders understand the prevailing mood of the market. Here's how it works:   Bullish Sentiment:   When the current price of a stock is holding above the VWAP line, it is often interpreted as a sign of bullish sentiment. This suggests that, on average, traders are willing to pay prices higher than the average daily price - indicating that buyers are in control.   Bearish Sentiment:   Conversely, when the price of a stock is below the VWAP, it indicates bearish sentiment. In this scenario, traders are willing to pay prices lower than the average daily price, implying that sellers are in control.   Examples:   Price Holding Above VWAP (Tesla 1min Candle Chart)   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   Price Holding Below VWAP (Tesla 1min Candle Chart)   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   2. Trending Market: Dynamic Support and Resistance   In a trending market, where a stock is moving in a clear upward or downward direction, VWAP serves as dynamic support and resistance. Here's how day traders use VWAP in this context:   Dynamic Support:   When a stock consistently trades above the VWAP line, VWAP acts as a dynamic support level. This means that, on average, the price of the stock remains above the VWAP, indicating a positive sentiment. Traders can use VWAP as a reference point to enter long positions, set stop-loss orders just below it, and potentially ride the trend for further gains.   Dynamic Resistance:   Conversely, when a stock remains below the VWAP, VWAP acts as dynamic resistance. This suggests that the average trading price for the day is above the current price, signifying a bearish sentiment. Traders can use VWAP as a reference point for entering short positions and managing risk by setting stop-loss orders just above it.   In both cases, VWAP serves as a dynamic level that adapts to the intraday price movements, providing guidance on when to enter trades and where to place protective stops.   Examples:   VWAP Dynamic Support in Uptrend   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   VWAP Dynamic Resistance in Downtrend in Uptrend   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   Sideways Market: Spotting Market Extremes   VWAP can be particularly valuable in identifying extremes in a sideways or range-bound market. An upper and lower band can be placed 2 standard deviations above and below the VWAP line (click settings on your VWAP indicator on TradingView to add the bands). Here's how day traders use VWAP to spot market extremes:   Overextension Above VWAP:   When a stock's price significantly extends above the upper VWAP band, it signals that price is more than 2 standard deviations away from the true average price for that day  leaving the stock vulnerable to mean reversion. Day traders can interpret this as a potential market extreme, suggesting that the stock may be overbought in the short term. This could be a signal for traders to consider taking profits on long positions or potentially entering short positions, anticipating a mean-reversion move back toward the VWAP.   Overextension Below VWAP:   Conversely, when a stock's price significantly drops below the lower VWAP band, it could signal overselling or excessive bearish sentiment. In this case, day traders may view it as a potential market extreme, indicating that the stock may be undervalued in the short term. This could be a signal for traders to consider taking profits on short positions or potentially entering long positions, expecting a mean-reversion move back toward the VWAP.   Example:   VWAP bands signal extremes in sideways market   Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results   In summary, VWAP, the Volume Weighted Average Price, is a valuable tool in a day trader's toolbox. It offers insights into market sentiment, dynamic support and resistance levels in trending markets, and extreme market conditions in sideways markets. As you continue your day trading journey, consider incorporating VWAP into your trading strategy to gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

I was expecting this drop on MARA to come fill the gap created before we had a MASSIVE move of almost 100%.   This retracement will give us an idea whether or not MARA is drilling its floor and preparing for reversal, or further down side to come.   Furthermore, we do have a trend pattern, however to me it is not exactly clear whether it is a wedge or an up trend, as I would not want to short after such a retracement.

Tesla   TSLA   shares plunged 16% over the five-day stretch ending October 20, as disappointing third-quarter earnings and a disastrous call led by CEO Elon Musk sparked a sell-off.   The nightmarish week wiped nearly $130 million off the EV maker's total market capitalization. while Musk's own personal fortune declined by around $30 billion, according to the   Bloomberg Billionaires Index   .   The stock is still up appr. 80% year-to-date, but has given up some of its gains over the past few months with the early-2023 hype around AI fading and investors starting to fret about the impact of higher interest rates.   Last Wednesday, on Oct 18, 2023 Tesla reported quarterly earnings that fell well short of Wall Street's expectations. The company posted adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.66, missing the consensus estimate of $0.74, and also underperformed analysts' revenue forecasts.   Musk then said in a post-earnings call that Tesla had likely ""dug  own grave with the Cybertruck"" due to enormous production challenges, and warned of several economic headwinds that could drag on demand.   Tesla just had its worst 4-months Red Combo since June 2023, while Tesla stocks price fading after that within four months in a row, from July till October (in this time).   Sure we can call this performance like a ""mini-disaster"", but still it's too early to say that world's richest man became a ""little baby"" who is ""fully in tears"".   Meanwhile strong and powerful technical analysis says that the carmaker's hellish string isn't a bad one, while buyout things right here to come.   Tesla stocks were doing well in June 2023, where bearish hugs and weekly SMA (52) were broken, so I have to say, there is almost no hellish right here, just a technical confirmation of reversal that has happened several months ago in 2023.   Tech graph below is a long-term view, with further updates on monthly/ quarterly basis."

The first pattern on todays chart is the four-month consolidation pattern between May and early October. SNPS was mostly trapped below $465 during that time. But it broke out on October 6 and is now pulling back to that level. Has old resistance become new support?   Second is the series of higher weekly lows during the period of consolidation. Those could reflect lurking buyers willing to step in.   Next, a rising trendline has taken shape since mid-August. Prices have also pulled back near that potential support.   Finally, the provider of semiconductor-design software seems to be in a secular uptrend. It broke out to record highs in May, despite the broader market remaining below the peak of early 2022. This could make trend followers anticipate continued momentum, especially with barely two months left in the year.

One such stock that merits attention is Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA). The stock, which is currently priced at $10.58, recorded a gain of 20.91% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 36.96%. The stock's fair valuation is $26.24, as indicated by its GF Value.   Understanding GF Value   The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:   1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.   2. Based on the company's past returns and growth.   3. Future estimates of the business performance.   We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.   Identifying Potential Risk Factors   However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.37. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.   Company Introduction   Marathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The Company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The Company's Crypto-currency Machines are located in the United States.   Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key Drivers   A dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:   The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.   The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.   In conclusion, despite its attractive valuation, Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) displays several risk factors that suggest it might be a potential value trap. The company's declining Working Capital to Total Assets ratio and EBIT to Total Assets ratio, along with its low Altman Z-Score, indicate potential financial distress. Therefore, careful due diligence is recommended before making an investment decision."

The stock price has been consistently trading below the orange and blue moving averages, reaffirming the bearish sentiment.   More recently, there seems to be an attempt at a reversal as the stock begins to trade above the moving averages and shows a pattern of higher highs and higher lows.   Support & Resistance Levels:   Bearish Line at 312.90 USD: This line seems to act as a recent support, where the price has bounced from it before. If the stock breaches this level going downward, it might continue its bearish trend.   Bullish Line at 317.36 USD: This is a significant resistance level where the price has struggled to break above.   Target Price 1 at 307.69 USD: This is the next significant support level below the bearish line, where the price might aim if it continues the bearish movement.   Target Price 2 at 321.15 USD: This is the next resistance level above the bullish line. Breaking above this level could further solidify a bullish trend.   Volume:   The trading volume is shown at the bottom of the chart. Notably, there seems to be a spike in volume during the bullish movement, suggesting increased buying interest.   Potential Reversal:   As the stock price begins to trade above the moving averages and starts forming higher highs and higher lows, this could be indicative of a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. However, it's crucial to monitor if the stock can maintain its position above the moving averages and break above the resistance levels to confirm this.   Ichimoku Cloud:   The stock is currently trading below the shaded area, which is typically seen as a bearish sign. However, it is inching closer to the cloud, suggesting potential bullish momentum if it can break and maintain above it.   To summarize, while the stock has shown a bearish trend for the majority of the visible period, there are recent signs of potential bullish momentum."

I have a suspicion that we may still be in the impulse wave of this new move from the bottom, currently moving into its last phase before a corrective wave.   According to Elliot Wave theory the second phase of the move cannot be the shortest (from 2 to 3) , as such it gives me an idea that we may still have one more push up.   It also has a potential to create an inverse head / shoulder pattern on the longer time frame while moving closer to the Bitcoin halving. It may only be a matter of time before this stock really makes a huge move.   Namaste"

It's not weird to see these dragon bottoms run all the way up to the extreme 4.286 fib extension, especially with meme stocks.   Look how the 4.286 is lining up with the 200 MA (thin, squiggly, blue line). And don't forget to mind the gap up there (gold circle). It should get filled in time.   And if you think I'm crazy, CGC did something similar just a few weeks ago.   *Mwah*. Beautiful.

My targets in SPY were very close to hit, & I get kind of a range of targets on the upside, so I'm just going to show all of them.   What can happen is it just gets really choppy up there or something, but I'm quite confident after tomorrow's dump, and possibly into Tuesday, there's a buying opportunity for swings up.   (Don't expect much on Wednesday but maybe volatility.)   Friday I had posted there would be a ""spike up and back down"". That certainly was a helluva spike! I later got the scenario it will be followed by a ""spike down and reversal up"", which is currently underway due to the violence in Israel. I'm currently receiving that scenario again today.   When I ask the advice on these targets, I get the answer: ""reaches target"". Targets are based on dowsing. The low shouldn't get less than ES 4250. I'm specifically looking for 4257-61 fyi.   I was getting this answer for ""reaches target"" as ""advice"" repeatedly leading into the recent lows, though they came just shy of targets.

2023-10-24 17:38:51,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/PLTR/VCiSQycp-Palantir-Technologies-PLTR/,"Palantir stock is set to pop in the next year as the tech firm erects an artificial intelligence ""fortress"" that will help it become one of the biggest players in the AI race in the coming decade, Wedbush Securities analysts wrote on Friday.   According to Wedbush's Dan Ives, Palantir is headed to $25 a share in the next 12 months. That represents a surge of 54% from Thursday's closing price of $16.15. Shares were up 5.7% at $17.07 early Friday.   The data software firm, which has been funded in part by the CIA's In-Q-Tel venture capital arm, is the ""Messi"" of AI, Ives said, referring to Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi.   ""As we begin the 4th Industrial Revolution, Palantir is engaging in the widespread trend of various industries leveraging recent generative AI innovations to streamline operations and improve expense profiles,"" the Wedbush analysts wrote. Given Palantir's wide roster of partners in both the public and private spheres, Wedbush sees the next six to 12 months as a period of significant expansion for the company as it serves the growing demand for enterprise-scale large language AI models.   ""This is early innings on a sum-of-the-parts AI story just on the cusp on monetizing this massive green field AI opportunity,"" it predicted.   Palantir CEO Alex Karp has been a vocal proponent of the rapid development of AI even in the face of risks associated with the technology.   In an op-ed for the New York Times this week, he wrote that AI will shape political developments in this century in the same way that nuclear weapons drove geopolitics in the last century. He cautioned that there are risks, but they should not deter the continued advancement of AI. ""If these technologies are to exist alongside us over the long term, it will also be essential to rapidly construct systems that allow more seamless collaboration between human operators and their algorithmic counterparts, to ensure that the machine remains subordinate to its creator,"" he wrote. ""We must not, however, shy away from building sharp tools for fear they may be turned against us.""   Palantir is one of the most popular stocks, and for many, it's been a wild ride. Since the direct listing, investors have seen shares skyrocket to the high   30S   , crash to $5.84, and ride the AI boom back to the high teens. I invested in PLTR at the direct listing and purchased shares on the way up and as they declined in price. I was vocal about my dissatisfaction with how Alex Karp handled what has now become the infamous Q2 2022 conference call and became bullish again as PLTR turned things around. 2023 has been a strong year for PLTR as shares have increased by 182.47% YTD. Some investors have done well, while others got back to even or chipped away at the losses. Since May 5, shares have appreciated by 143.59%, appreciating from $7.41 to $18.05. Q2 2023 earnings are around the corner as PLTR is set to report post-market on August 7. Shares can continue higher into earnings and continue throughout 2023 if PLTR delivers growth across its revenue, earnings, customers, and contracts while maintaining its Q2 free cash flow (FCF) margins. In this article, I will discuss what I am looking for in the Q2 2023 earnings report and provide some insights as to what I think shares of PLTR could be worth in the future.   In 2021, PLTR made 45 official announcements through its website newsroom, and in 2022, PLTR had 44 announcements. PLTR has been busy in 2023; through July 18, they have made 26 official announcements. This doesn't include any of the blog posts PLTR has written discussing the work their conducting. I continuously research these aspects as they provide insight into what will be discussed on the earnings call and in the 10-Q. In Q2 2023, PLTR posted 14 press releases and another four in July. For PLTR to continue its growth trajectory, it needs more adaptation of its products in the government space as well as the private sector.   I expect PLTR to deliver strong growth numbers as there have been significant partnerships announced since April 1. On the government side, Palantir announced two deals with government entities in Ukraine, including the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine and the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. PLTR announced that Ukraine would utilize its technology to support the defense and reconstruction of the country and empower Ukraine investigators with critical data processing tools regarding 78,000 registered war crimes. US Special Operations Command entered a multi-year contract worth up to $463 million to expand its enterprise capabilities.   On the commercial side, PLTR expanded its cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), entered into an agreement to build an integrated management flow system on top of Foundry for CA Modas S.A, and expanded its partnership with Jacobs Solutions (J). These partnerships are critical because it will allow PLTR to expand throughout several sectors through some of the largest counterparts. I expect the Jacobs and Microsoft partnerships to be extremely beneficial in the coming years as more companies look to create value by enabling AI and moving toward data-driven decisions.   PLTR guided for revenue to come in at $528-$532 million in Q2 and revenue of $2.185-$2.235 billion for the full year. In Q1, PLTR delivered $525.2 million in revenue which is 24.04% of the low-end estimates and 23.5% of the high-end estimates for 2023. For PLTR to meet its 2023 full-year revenue guidance, it would need to generate an average of $553.27 million in Q2Q4 to meet the low-end projection and an average of $569.94 to meet the high-end estimates.   I expect PLTR to deliver at least $550 million in revenue for Q2 and discuss how they will increase incremental revenue throughout the year as more contracts continue to be initiated on an ongoing basis. If we see anywhere from $550-$575 million in revenue for Q2, it would be a strong indication that the high-end estimates will be met or exceeded when they report their 2023 fiscal year numbers. If PLTR records $550 million in Q2, $575 million in Q3, and $601 million in Q4, PLTR will generate $2.25 billion in annual revenue for 2023. This would be an average QoQ revenue increase of 4.6% over the next three quarters. I think it will be a strong signal coming off the AIP conference if PLTR is on track to beat the high-end estimates, as that would mean PLTR will be moving into the $600 million quarterly revenue bracket sometime in 2023 and inching their way closer to generating over $1 billion in revenue on a quarterly basis.   PLTR has now strung together two consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability and is projecting its adjusted income from operations coming in at $118-$122 million in 2023 and between $506-$556 million for their fiscal year. In Q1 2023, PLTR generated $125.11 million in adjusted income from operations, which is 24.73% of the low-end projection and 22.50% of the high-end estimate. This would mean that PLTR would need to increase its adjusted income throughout the year to meet its annualized projections.   I dislike adjusted numbers and prefer free cash flow (FCF) as it's harder to distort than other profitability measures. In Q1, PLTR generated $188.9 million in adjusted FCF, which is a 36% margin. PLTR's true FCF number was $182.6 million, as they generated $187.4 million in cash from operations and allocated $4.8 million toward CapEx. This places PLTR's FCF margin at 34.77%, which is the largest margin they have operated at since becoming a publicly traded company.   I have previously indicated that I believe PLTR can replicate similar growth to Salesforce (CRM). CRM currently has a market cap of $223.51 billion and, in the TTM, has generated $32.19 billion of revenue and $7.06 billion in FCF. Mr. Market is valuing CRM at a 6.94x multiple on sales, and 31.64x FCF. CRM has seen explosive growth over the last decade as its grown its revenue by 690.67% and its FCF by 1,125.54%. Including the TTM, CRM has operated at a 20.57% FCF margin over the previous five years.If PLTR finishes on the high-end of their revenue estimates for 2023 they would deliver $2.25 billion in revenue. PLTR's previous projections placed their 2025 revenue at $4 billion or more and I don't recall seeing updated estimates. If PLTR comes in on the high end of the 2023 projections and generates $2.25 billion, its YoY revenue growth would have decelerated from 41.11% in 2021 to 23.61% in 2022 and 18.12% in 2023. Hypothetically, if PLTR can grow its revenue at a 15% YoY basis over the next decade from 20242033, it would generate $2.98 billion in revenue for 2025 and $9.12 billion in 2033. At a 33% FCF margin in 2033, PLTR would generate $3 billion in FCF. At a 32x multiple on FCF, PLTR would be valued at $96.17 billion.   If PLTR can maintain an 18% YoY revenue growth rate and maintain a 33% FCF margin, PLTR will generate $11.78 billion in revenue and $3.89 billion in FCF in 2033. At a 32x FCF multiple, PLTR would be valued at $124.42 billion. If PLTR was to grow at a quicker pace of 21% YoY on average, they would generate $15.15 billion in revenue and $5 billion in FCF in 2033. Assigning a 32x multiple on their FCF would place PLTR at a $159.93 billion valuation.   Based on these assumptions, PLTR could grow between 151.49%-318.23% over the next decade, which would be an annualized return of 15.15%-31.82%. These are just assumptions regarding what could occur and why I feel PLTR could be a good long-term investment.   For those who think a 32x multiple on FCF is a crazy valuation, I am going to place a table below. Based on the current market caps, big tech has multiples from 31.29x to 221.31x. Putting the outliers aside, it's not uncommon to see companies trade in the 40x range. Even companies such as the Coca-Cola Company (KO) trade at a 29.90x multiple and PepsiCo (PEP) trade at a 45.41x multiple on FCF."

2023-10-25 06:26:49,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AAPL/pmHMR643-Investors-Holy-Grail-The-Business-Economic-Cycle/,"The business cycle describes how the economy expands and contracts over time. It is an upward and downward movement of the gross domestic product along with its long-term growth rate.   The business cycle consists o   f 6 phases/stages   :   1. Expansion   2. Peak   3. Recession   4. Depression   5. Trough   6. Recovery   1) Expansion   :   Sectors Affected:   Technology, Consumer discretion   Expansion is the first stage of the business cycle. The economy moves slowly upward, and the cycle begins.   The government strengthens the economy:   Lowering taxes   Boost in spending.   - When the growth slows, the central bank reduces rates to encourage businesses to borrow.   - As the economy expands, economic indicators are likely to show positive signals, such as employment, income, wages, profits, demand, and supply.   - A rise in employment increases consumer confidence increasing activity in the housing markets, and growth turns positive. A high level of demand and insufficient supply lead to an increase in the price of production. Investors take a loan with high rates to fill the demand pressure. This process continues until the economy becomes favorable for expansion.   2) Peak   :   Sector Affected   : Financial, energy, materials   - The second stage of the business cycle is the peak which shows the maximum growth of the economy. Identifying the end point of an expansion is the most complex task because it can last for serval years.   - This phase shows a reduction in unemployment rates. The market continues its positive outlook. During expansion, the central bank looks for signs of building price pressures, and increased rates can contribute to this peak. The central bank also tries to protect the economy against inflation in this stage.   - Since employment rates, income, wages, profits, demand & supply are already high, there is no further increase.   - The investor will produce more and more to fill the demand pressure. Thus, the investment and product will become expensive. At this time point, the investor will not get a return due to inflation. Prices are way higher for buyers to buy. From this situation, a recession takes place. The economy reverses from this stage.   3) Recession   :   Sector Affected   : Utilities, healthcare, consumer staples   - Two consecutive quarters of back-to-back declines in gross domestic product constitute a recession.   - The recession is followed by a peak phase. In this phase economic indicators start melting down. The demand for the goods decreased due to expensive prices. Supply will keep increasing, and on the other hand, demand will begin to decline. That causes an ""excess of supply"" and will lead to falling in prices.   4) Depression   :   - In more prolonged downturns, the economy enters into a depression phase. The period of malaise is called depression. Depression doesn't happen often, but when they do, there seems to be no amount of policy stimulus that can lift consumers and businesses out of their slumps. When The economy is declining and falling below steady growth, this stage is called depression.   - Consumers don't borrow or spend because they are pessimistic about the economic outlook. As the central bank cuts interest rates, loans become cheap, but businesses fail to take advantage of loans because they can't see a clear picture of when demand will start picking up. There will be less demand for loans. The business ends up sitting on inventories & pare back production, which they already produced.   - Companies lay off more and more employees, and the unemployment rate soars and confidence flatters.   5) Trough   :   - When economic growth becomes negative, the outlook looks hopeless. Further decline in demand and supply of goods and services will lead to more fall in prices.   - It shows the maximum negative situation as the economy reached its lowest point. All economic indicators will be worse. Ex. The highest rate of unemployment, and No demand for goods and services(lowest), etc. After the completion, good time starts with the recovery phase.   6) Recovery   :   Affected sectors:   Industrials, materials, real estate   - As a result of low prices, the economy begins to rebound from a negative growth rate, and demand and production are both starting to increase.   - Companies stop shedding employees and start finding to meet the current level of demand. As a result, they are compelled to hire. As the months pass, the economy is once in expansion.   - The business cycle is important because investors attempt to concentrate their investments on those that are expected to do well at a certain time of the cycle.   - Government and the central bank also take action to establish a healthy economy. The government will increase expenditure and also take steps to increase production.   After the recovery phases, the economy again enters the expansion phase.   Safe heaven/Defensive Stocks - It maintains or anticipates its values over the crisis, then does well. We can even expect good returns in these asset classes. Ex. utilities, health care, consumer staples, etc.   (""WE WILL DISCUSS MORE IN OUR UPCOMING ARTICLE DUE TO ARTICLE LENGTH."")

2023-10-25 06:25:19,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/QQQ/nlAlmiuN-Part-2-Price-Action-Breakdown-Advance-Elements/,"In the first part, we discussed the components of the price action theory. We covered value area, control line, and excess price with examples, setups & guidelines (with my own observations.) Now, in this idea, we are going to cover the following topics:   No trading zone   Initiative & responsive trading   Shifting of the value area   Bullish Value area   Bearish value area   Extention of the value area   Combining all the pieces   I request all of you to visit our first part if you have not read it yet.   Check out the following demo chart, and try to mention each component by yourself:   Now, you can check the following chart, and see if you have denoted correctly or noted:   1) No trading zone:   No trading zone/activities is the area where trading is not happening. It shows the strength of buyers in the lower band and the strength of the sellers in the upper boundary. Its shows who is controlling, who will be controlling, and who have lost the opportunity.   What does it mean?   If the length of the no-trading zone is wide at the lower band, it shows that buyers are controlling the movement and sellers are not able to form trading activities.   If the length of the no-trading zone is wide at the upper band, it shows that sellers are controlling the movement and buyers are not able to form trading activities.   Observing the given formation that shows a sideways value area is enough to understand the whole story. There were actually three no-trading zones in the value area: two on the lower band and one on the upper band.   The first NTZ(No-trading zone) on the lower band was the signal of the movement controlled by buyers. NTZ-2 was the widest of the value area, where sellers snatched the control from buyers and started outnumbering the buyers.  NTZ-3 was the last no-trading zone where the buyers were on the controlled buy and couldn't give a response to the sellers' initiative move. The excess was the last price point from sellers that started the supply pressure.   2) Initiative & responsive trading   As we discussed earlier, price movements are the result of the interaction between supply and demand. Buyer(demand) and seller's(supply) intuition are the main components of the price.   Value area from where buyers and sellers are satisfied with the current prices. Neither buyers want to increase, nor the seller is interested in low prices at least for some duration. It's called equilibrium between buyers and sellers.   What if it's enough?   # Now buyers don't want to keep the prices as it's too low for them. So, the buyers will make an initiative to break the upper band of the value area. It is called ""initiative"" by buyers.   # Sellers have to stop them from going out of the value area by making excess, which is called ""response"" by sellers. Anyone, either buyers or sellers, who are not satisfied can make an initiative. However, the opposite party has to respond to their initiative and settle into equilibrium again.   Case 1:   - The movement can only reach equilibrium by responding to each initiative. If a failure occurs, it signals evidence of a big move in the direction of the initiative. As per the chart, whenever buyers have made an initiative to move outside of the value area, sellers have responded with supply pressure and vice versa.   Case 2:   - Buyers have made an initiative, but sellers couldn't hold back the buyers' pressure and ended up losing movement. Here, we can say that the buyers have given a breakout of the value area, and the sellers' response was a failure.   3) Shifting of the value area   - Traders don't have to be upset after the breakout of the value area. Supply and demand will balance and unbalance again, and traders will get an opportunity to trade according to the theory. We all know of the tenet of the dow theory that   ""price tends to trend   ."" Value area also shifts its value after the breakout/breakdown, often in the direction of the trend.   Uptrend:   The price was in an uptrend. After the breakout of the first value area, it has formed the second, and so on.   Downtrend:   The price was in a downtrend. After the breakdown of the first value area, it has formed the second, and so on."

2023-10-24 17:41:54,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AMD/Gx75pE4y-Advanced-Micro-Devices-AMD/,"Team RED is READY   As with any competitor, a quarterly earnings report from a peer can provide great insight into the market. For Advanced Micro Devices, the Q2'23 earnings report from Intel provides great views on the surging demand for AI chips and a rebound in PC demand crucial for AMD   The most immediate signal from Intel beating Q2'23 estimates and guiding up for Q3 is the rebound in PC demand. Most importantly, the inventory correction appears over with OEMs no longer digesting chip inventory.Back in Q3'22, AMD shocked the market by cutting PC revenue estimates by $1 billion. The company quickly went from $2 billion in quarterly CPU sales for PCs to less than $1 billion.   Intel still reported Q2 Client Computing revenue was down 12% YoY to $6.8 billion, but the number was up $1.0 billion sequentially. The chip giant guided up Q3 revenue to $13.4 billion, up $0.5 billion sequentially.In Q1'23, AMD reported that client revenues had fallen further to only $739 million. AMD CPU revenues are now far over $1 billion per quarter below the peak levels providing substantial upside potential when the PC market normalizes.   Intel discussed a mixed picture for their business in the near term due to AI. The chip giant is seeing a wallet share shift from the sever CPU spend towards AI chips.The move is both good and bad for AMD. The company has the MI300 AI GPU chip hitting the market in Q4 providing a strong competitor to the booming demand for the H100 from Nvidia, but the chip isn't out on the market yet.   In the near term, AMD may see some suppressed data center demand while heading into 2024. Ultimately, the company should see upside from AI demand for the MI300 along with the Alveo AI accelerator.On the Q2'23 earnings call, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger suggested the AI pipeline for 2024 had surged to $1 billion: In my formal remarks, we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline, 6x in the last quarter.   Going back a few months, Morgan Stanley had estimated the AI potential for AMD was only $400 million with upside potential to $1.2 billion. The Intel forecasts would suggest the AI potential for AMD is far higher next year when the MI300 is in full-scale production.   Nvidia guided up current quarter sales estimates by 50% to over $11 billion. The company suggested data center sales would reach $7+ billion in the quarter.   AMD has only seen data center sales reach $1.3 billion in quarterly sales leaving a huge gap from Nvidia. Even Intel still hit $4.0 billion in data center sales during Q2'23, though the amount is down nearly 20% form 2022 levels due in part to losing market share to AMD.   The big issue for AMD is whether data center sales growth stalls causing a miss to 2H sales targets while booming AI demand ultimately boosts sales starting in Q1'24, or maybe Q4. The chip company peaked at quarterly sales of $6.6 billion back Q2'22 and the current quarterly analyst estimates aren't very aggressive.   A rebound in PC demand to more normalized levels places AMD back at the Q4'23 revenue target of $6.5 billion alone. A PC rebound to normal digestion ($2 billion quarterly run rate) along with higher data center or AI demand leads to vastly higher revenues in 2024.   The current analysts aren't even factoring in much growth in the Q2'24 revenue estimate of $6.76 billion. The amount is just 4% upside from Q2'22 despite potentially surging demand from AMD entering the AI GPU space.   AMD is set to report earrings after the close on August 1. Investors should focus less on the Q2 numbers or even Q3 guidance and focus more on a return to more normalized revenue levels plus the upside from AI.Our view has long held that AMD has the earnings potential of $5 to $6 and the AI opportunity is all upside to this view.   The key investor takeaway is that AMD is still $50 below all time highs while Nvidia has soared over $100 above the late 2021 highs. Investors should use the current weakness in AMD to load up on the stock while leaving some capital to buy any weakness following Q2 earnings due to the potential for near term disappointment leading to long term opportunities."

The focal point of the auto giants earnings release will be its global wholesale volumes from the Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments.   Q2 Highlights   Ford reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share for second-quarter 2023, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents and increased from 68 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Higher-than-expected automotive revenues resulted in the outperformance. The companys consolidated second-quarter revenues came in at $44,954 million, rising 11.8% year over year.   In the second quarter, total wholesale volume in the Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments increased 7% year over year to 720,000 units and 8% year over year to 365,000, respectively. EBIT from Ford Blue and Pro units came in at $2,308 million and $2,391 million, respectively.   Ford reported adjusted free cash flow (FCF) of $2,919 million during the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $26,406 million as of Jun 30, 2023. Long-term debt, excluding Ford Credit, totaled $19.17 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023.   Factors at Play   While Ford Blue focuses on the firms legacy gas-powered business, Ford Pro deals with commercial vehicles and services. Expected higher year-over-year growth in global wholesale shipments and adjusted EBIT from these segments are likely to have positively impacted Fords upcoming results.   Our estimate for global wholesale shipments from Ford Blue and Ford Pro segments is pegged at 750,000 and 382,000 units, suggesting a year-over-year uptick of 1.2% and 19%, respectively. Our forecast for third-quarter Ford Blue and Ford Pro adjusted EBIT implies an uptick of 6.2% and a whopping 370.1% on a year-over-year basis.   The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty set the stage for promising results for the Ford Pro segment. In the quarter under discussion, Ford's commercial vans, led by the Transit van, continued to perform strongly. Transit van sales surged by 28.3%, with 34,006 vans sold, maintaining its position as America's top-selling commercial van. Ford E-Series vans also saw a 13.4% increase in the third quarter. Ford held the top spot in commercial sales, with a 40.5% market share, up 2.1% from the previous year. The Ford Pro segment is expected to have benefited from high demand for E-Transit vans. In the third quarter, the California Vanpool Authority (CalVans) announced the purchase of over 400 new Ford E-Transit vans through Model 1, a leading electric school bus distributor, expanding its fleet by 40% and reducing its fuel and CO2 emissions in California.   Ford Blue segment is set to reflect benefits from high ICE-powered vehicles, which rose 5.4% year over year to 444,681 units in the third quarter of 2023. Notably, the 2024 Ford Mustang debuted in August and for the third quarter, it recorded 9,844 sales, with the first full month of sales occurring in September. Notably, 67% of the Mustang's third-quarter sales, equating to 6,575 units, were realized in September.

2023-10-25 16:12:05,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TLT/6gd5XEnZ-Is-it-possible-to-remove-the-direction-from-trading/,"This title is crazy enough for ordinary traders to be dismissed and not read!   Yes, it is possible to remove the direction from trading by using directional neutral strategies. These strategies are designed to profit from both up and down markets, regardless of the overall trend.   One common directional neutral strategy is to pair trade. This involves taking two positions that are expected to move in opposite directions. For example, a trader might buy a stock that is expected to outperform the market and sell a stock that is expected to underperform the market.   Another common directional neutral strategy is to trade volatility. This involves buying and selling options or other derivatives that profit from changes in volatility. For example, a trader might buy a put option on a stock that they believe is overvalued, in anticipation of the stock price falling.   Directional neutral strategies can be more complex to implement than traditional directional strategies, but they can also be less risky. This is because they are not reliant on the market moving in a particular direction.   Here are some examples of directional neutral strategies:   Long-short portfolio:   This involves holding a portfolio of both long and short positions in different stocks or sectors. The goal is to generate profits from the relative performance of the different stocks or sectors, regardless of the overall market direction.   Market neutral portfolio:   This involves holding a portfolio of assets that are expected to have a low correlation to each other. The goal is to generate profits from the relative performance of the different assets, regardless of the overall market direction.   Volatility trading:   This involves buying and selling options or other derivatives that profit from changes in volatility. The goal is to generate profits from the movement of volatility, regardless of the overall market direction.   Directional neutral strategies can be used by a variety of traders, including hedge funds, institutional investors, and retail traders. However, it is important to note that these strategies can be more complex to implement than traditional directional strategies. It is also important to have a good understanding of the risks involved before using directional neutral strategies.   Here is 2 example of such trade Ideas published publicly and generating +55%(TLT), and +201%(QQQ) so far! Both trades were based on the Long Strangle Option strategy at the right time to benefit from the upcoming volatility in the market!   But How did I learn to do that?   After reading 3 important books:   The man who solved the market (Jim Simons)   The man for all the markets(Ed Thorp)   Fooled By Randomness (Nassim Taleb)   I realized the trading strategies of professional traders like Ed Thorp, Nasim Taleb, and Jim Simon have some common features. They do not predict the direction of the market but instead, focus on finding and exploiting mispricings. They also use non-biased strategies.   Read these 3 books, and it will unlock the opportunities in the market that you can not see before reading these books!   If you do not like mathematics! forget this post!"

There is a convergence of moving averages, and the price is above the short-term moving average, which signifies bullish momentum.   The longer-term moving average acts as a resistance, which the stock is testing.   Support and Resistance Levels:   Bullish Line: This seems to indicate the immediate support level around $431.54. It's the point where buyers seem to step in.   Bearish Line: This line signifies a recent low or support-turned-resistance at approximately $426.27.   Target Price 1: At approximately $439.88, this is a level the stock might aspire to reach in a bullish scenario.   Target Price 2: At around $447.37, this is a higher level that the stock might target if the momentum continues.   Target Price 3: The most optimistic target at approximately $457.50, suggesting a strong bullish move.   Volume:   The volume bars at the bottom show significant trading activity, with a mix of high volume both on upward and downward movements. The most recent bar shows a spike in volume, suggesting increased interest or activity around the current price level.   RSI (Relative Strength Index):   This isn't directly labeled, but the oscillating line below the volume likely represents the RSI, which measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.   It appears to be hovering around the mid-range, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.   From a technical perspective, it seems NVIDIA is experiencing bullish momentum, testing the longer-term moving average as resistance. If it breaks above this resistance with significant volume, it could aim for the target prices mentioned. However, if it faces a rejection, it could retest the bullish line or even the bearish line as support."

If we take the fibo 424.77 to 417.81 the second bar closed on top and also above 38.2% levels.   At the same time we had a divergence in Elliott oscillator. For target we can draw a fibo from 420.46 to 417.81. That gave us 424.75 to 426.5.   High was 424.45. It was nearly 1:1 trade. Risky but worth it as it was steep fall last few days.   Now the rise 417.81 to 424.45 retraced to 61.8% around 420.5.   So, if we take the fall 424.45 to 420.25, we can expect a retracement to 422.5 levels.   As of now 412-414 looks more probable than 426-430 levels which is 100 and 200 averages.   As the moving averages are sloping downwards, we can expect a consolidation around 418-420.

As expected, it got rejected, also bumping into the 200 SMA (4hr)with a huge rejection, confirming it is still in a strong bear-trend now. We are also way below on the 200day SMA, and also the 200week SMA.   On the weekly, we are loosing momentum, but some upside is expected on the short-term.   I assume (but price actions will tell), this short term uptrend will help to finish the smaller formation on the new Head and Shoulders, which I highlighted with paintbrush in white.   Currently, we are in the consolidation zone, chances are, we are going up a bit to create the top of the right sholder with the target of 9.40-9.60, then going back down to the consolidation zone.   Also, there is a possibility we have a very shallow right shoulder almost formed already, going down directly, I will wait for confirmation.

2023-10-25 06:25:54,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NVDA/tofKAksv-Financial-Planning-An-Idea/,"Hello Trader   Today we have to talk about financial knowledge, how important is it to have financial knowledge and whether can it make us financially free.   Let's begin,   Everyone needs money to survive. Financial planning is the process of managing your money wisely to achieve your financial goals. It involves planning your future finances keeping in mind your current situation.   In simple terms, financial planning helps you answer questions like:   How can I save more money?   When can I comfortably retire?   How can I pay my debts?   All these questions are very important if you want to be financially free   *   Financial planning helps you identify your long-term and short-term goals, whether it's buying a house, children's education, or retirement so that you don't have to worry about anything.   *   An important aspect of financial planning is insurance. It helps protect you and your loved ones from unexpected events like accidents, illnesses, or the loss of a loved one. By getting the right insurance coverage, you can minimize the financial disaster of such situations.   *   Investments are also a part of financial planning. It involves putting your money into different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, to grow your wealth over time. Financial planning also involves knowing where to allocate your investments accurately.   Finally, financial planning includes preparing for retirement. It involves estimating how much money you will need in retirement and determining how much you should save each month to reach that goal. Retirement planning ensures that you can enjoy a comfortable and financially secure life after you stop working.   Types of financial planning   1) Tax Planning   Tax planning is the process of arranging your finances in a smart way to pay the least amount of taxes while staying within the rules set by the government. It involves making decisions about when to receive income, how to spend money, and which deductions or credits to take advantage of. The goal is to legally reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay, so you can keep more of your hard-earned money.   Types of Tax planning   Tax planning is a way to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. But it's not just about that - it also tells you how to make smart decisions with your money to reach your financial goals. By investing in the right things at the right time, you can increase not only the tax but also your wealth. So tax planning is not just about minimizing taxes, it's about making your money work for you.   Following are the various methods of tax planning   (A) Short-term tax planning   In short-term tax planning, individuals or businesses focus on finding legal ways to reduce their tax liability as the end of the fiscal year approaches. It does not require long-term commitments but can still result in significant tax savings.   (B) Long-term tax planning   With long-term tax planning, individuals or businesses create a tax plan at the beginning of the fiscal year and follow it throughout the year. While immediate tax benefits may not be available, this approach can be beneficial in the long run.   (C) Permissive tax planning   Permissive tax planning involves utilizing various provisions within the tax laws of a country, such as deductions, exemptions, contributions, and incentives. For example, in India, there are provisions like Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which offer deductions on specific tax-saving investments.   (D) Purposive tax planning   Purposive tax planning involves using tax-saving instruments with a specific purpose in mind. This strategy ensures that you maximize the benefits of your investments. It includes carefully selecting suitable investments, having a plan for replacing assets if necessary, and diversifying business and income assets based on your residency status.   2) insurance planning   If you don't plan properly for insurance, unexpected events in life can leave you financially vulnerable. By insurance planning, you can identify the risks that may affect your life and choose the right insurance policy to protect against those risks. So that you can protect yourself and your family financially in the future.   Let's talk about the benefits of insurance planning   (A) Protection from Unexpected Events   Having a good insurance policy helps you reduce the financial risks associated with things like illness, accidents, or even death. It ensures that you and your family are prepared to face these unexpected challenges without having to give up your quality of life.   (B) Different Types of Insurance Coverage   *   There are different types of insurance policies that cover various risks. For example, health insurance plans cover medical emergencies, hospital expenses, medications, and doctor visits.   *   Life insurance or personal accident insurance provides coverage in case of premature death.   *   Motor insurance protects your vehicles against theft, accidents, and liabilities to third parties.   *   Travel insurance policies offer coverage for unexpected events during your trips. By choosing the right combination of policies, you can create a complete financial protection plan for yourself and your family.   (C) Financial Protection   Insurance planning provides financial security by compensating for losses incurred during covered emergencies. It helps you recover financially from unexpected situations and protects your savings.   (D) Tax Benefits   Certain insurance plans also provide tax savings. For example, the premiums you pay for health insurance are eligible for tax deductions under the Income Tax Act. This means you can lower your taxable income by purchasing specific insurance policies.   (E) Peace of Mind   Having a well-planned insurance portfolio gives you peace of mind. You don't have to worry about losing your savings due to unforeseen events. You can also plan for the financial well-being of your family even after your death by using term and life insurance plans.   Insurance planning can be easier if these points are kept in mind   3) Investment planning   *   Investment planning is a process that helps you make smart decisions about your money.   *   It involves thinking about your goals and figuring out the best ways to use your money to achieve those goals.   *   There are various options for investment, such as putting your money in stocks, bonds, or property and earning good profits.   *   This planning helps you build a strong financial foundation and make adjustments as needed.   Here I will tell about 7 benefits of investment planning   (A) Building Wealth   Investment plans with life insurance are a reliable way to grow your wealth over time. As an investor, you can choose the plan that best suits your needs based on risk, returns, and the amount you can invest. These plans can provide financial assistance for future expenses like your child's education, their wedding, your retirement, or a pension.   (B) Financial Security   Life insurance policies offer both life coverage and investment options. They take care of your family financially by providing both survival benefits and death benefits. When the policy matures, you receive returns with profits. This ensures long-term financial security for your family. In the unfortunate event of your demise before the maturity period, the insurance company pays the sum assured to your nominee, providing financial protection to your family.   (C) Coverage for Death Risk   Not all investment options offer coverage for the risk of death, but investment plans with life insurance do. These plans include death risk coverage, ensuring that your family's financial needs are taken care of even in your absence. The sum assured is paid to the nominee in the event of your death.   (D)Retirement Savings   You can purchase these investment plans at any stage of life, allowing you to create a retirement corpus. By investing in these plans, you can become financially independent even after retirement.   (E) Flexibility   These investment plans offer flexibility in terms of the amount you can invest and the duration. You can choose what suits your needs and financial planning.   (E) Tax Savings   Investment plans not only provide risk cover and help accumulate wealth, but they also offer tax savings. The premiums and payouts are exempted from tax under sections 80C and 10(10D) of the Indian Tax Act. These plans offer a perfect combination of savings, wealth creation, financial protection, and tax benefits.   (F) Loan Facility   Life insurance investment plans can also act as loan facilitators, depending on the coverage you have, the premiums paid, and your eligibility for the loan amount.   4)  Retirement planning   *   Retirement planning is the process of preparing for life after you stop working.   *   It involves thinking about how much money you will need to live comfortably when you are not earning a regular income.   *   Retirement planning tells you how to save and invest your money wisely to have enough funds to support yourself during your retirement years.   *   Retirement planning is essential so that you can enjoy a comfortable and worry-free life when you decide to stop working.   Understanding retirement planning   *   Retirement planning is the act of preparing for life after employment, which includes not only financial aspects but all areas of one's life.   *   Beyond financial considerations, retirement planning includes lifestyle choices, such as how to spend time, where to live, and when to stop working altogether.   *   Retirement planning focuses on different stages of life.   *   In the early stages of a career, the emphasis is on setting aside sufficient funds for retirement.   *   As one approaches mid-career, it may also include establishing specific income or wealth goals and taking the necessary steps to achieve them.   *   Thus, retirement planning is necessary for you to lead a comfortable life at the time of retirement.   5) Estate planning   *   Estate planning is when you make important decisions about what happens to your money, assets, and liabilities after you pass away or if you become unable to make decisions for yourself.   *   This includes things like choosing who will receive your assets, making sure debts and taxes are taken care of, and even deciding who will take care of your children or pets.   *   People usually work with an attorney who knows estate law to help them plan.   *   Some common steps in estate planning include making an inventory of what you own and owe and checking your bank account.   Process of Estate Planning   *   Estate planning is the process of deciding what will happen to a person's assets after they pass away and how their financial affairs will be managed if they become unable to do so themselves. It's important to know that estate planning is not only for wealthy individuals; anyone can and should consider it.   *   An estate includes things like houses, cars, investments, artwork, life insurance, pensions, and debts. People have different reasons for estate planning, such as preserving family wealth, providing for their spouse and children, funding education for future generations, or leaving a charitable legacy.   *   The first step in estate planning is usually creating a will.   Other important tasks include   *   Setting up trust accounts to reduce estate taxes and benefit specific beneficiaries.   *   Designating a guardian for dependents who are still alive.   *   Choosing an executor to oversee the will's instructions.   *   Updating beneficiaries on life insurance policies, IRAs, and 401(k) accounts.   *   Making funeral arrangements in advance.   *   Making annual gifts to charities or nonprofits to lower the taxable estate.   *   Creating a durable power of attorney to handle other assets and investments.   By taking these steps, individuals can ensure that their wishes are followed, their loved ones are provided for, and their assets are distributed as intended.   6) Cash flow planning   *   Cash flow planning is all about managing and predicting how money comes into and goes out of someone's or a business's finances. It means keeping track of how much money is earned (income) and how much is spent (expenses) during a specific time, usually every month or year.   *   The main goal of cash flow planning is to make sure there's enough money to cover important expenses, meet financial commitments, and achieve money-related objectives. It helps individuals and businesses make smart choices when it comes to spending, saving, and investing their money.   *   Basically, cash flow planning involves creating a budget or financial plan that outlines the expected sources of income and estimates of expenses. By analyzing and keeping an eye on cash flow, it becomes possible to spot potential shortages or surpluses and adjust accordingly. This way, people can manage their money better and make informed decisions on how to use their resources effectively.   *   When there's a clear understanding of cash flow, individuals and businesses can take proactive steps to ensure they have enough money to cover their needs, save for the future, and handle any unexpected financial challenges that might come up.   *   Thus by doing financial planning in this way and by doing this 6-step planning you can become financially free.

Firstly, our Fibonacci levels are proving the golden pocket at the 0.618 to be a resistance zone several times for Tesla. We are seeing a push back towards this zone with the formation of a bearish wedge that is more likely to break to the down side than the upside.   Additionally, Tesla vehicles are becoming increasingly more affordable as they continue to slash prices on newer vehicles which may have a negative impact on the overall bottom line for Tesla.   The current yield curve is at the worst level in 40 years, which has historically been a strong indicator for the recession to begin with 12-18 months. We will be approaching that time frame towards the later part of the year which may have a drastic effect on risk assets."

This news may positively impact the Riskified Ltd (NYSE: RSKD) stocks; therefore, we focus on the company's stock chart today.   On the D1 timeframe, support has formed at 3.57, with resistance at 4.30. These levels are determined based on the price's highs and lows during the latest downward trend.   The support at 3.57 is strong since the quotes have not approached it for over a year. If the descending trend continues, a ""false"" breakout will likely form from this level, followed by a trend change.   On the H1 timeframe, if quotes return to 3.57, the next target for the price increase can be around 4.30. In this case, a rebound from support on D1 is expected.

2023-10-24 14:32:22,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/COIN/rQ8UAeuA-Coinbase-Gearing-Up-for-its-next-Move/,"Hi guys! This is an Update on recent Technical developments found for Coinbase (COIN).   I've successfully identified the Inverse Head & Shoulders Pattern. Check out that idea down below.   We have completed the Return Rally back to test Support on the Neckline. Now ive been assessing if there are signs that we continue the Inverse Head and Shoulders with our final explosive breakout move.   This analysis is done on the 1 day timeframe.   As you can see we have tested and CONFIRMED Support on the Neckline.   After doing so we have inched higher.   Notice now, we are ABOVE the 21 EMA.   With the last 3 days of candles, forming LOWER WICKS off the 21 EMA.   This is a great sign of SUPPORT.   We must continue to stay ABOVE the 21 EMA.   Being Above the 21 EMA on any timeframe indicates that we will most likely have an UPTREND in price.   Notice also the Orange Rectangle. This highlights a consolidation zone. This shows to me that we are building up momentum for our final rally of the Inverse Head & Shoulders Pattern.   A confirmation ABOVE the Upper Border of Rectangle, will indicate Rally may be starting.   To keep us on our toes, just remember that if price action goes BELOW the Lower Border of the Rectangle, we risk testing the Neckline again. Which is always a   possibility   . As long as we maintain the Neckline as Support, we good.   Watch VOLUME -> We need it to start picking up for indication of the major move.   This move will essentially lead to trend reversal  for COIN, confirming the bottom.   __________________________________________________________________________________   Thank you for taking the time to read my analysis.

A parallel downtrend consists of two downward sloping trend lines that chart the lower highs and lower lows of an asset over time. This break could signify a potential shift in investor sentiment and may be indicative of a forthcoming bullish cycle.   The break from a downtrend is often considered a bullish signal in technical analysis and could be followed by an upward momentum. However, traders should exercise caution and look for confirmation through other technical indicators such as volume, moving averages, or Relative Strength Index (RSI) to validate the trend reversal. High trading volumes accompanying the break could bolster the case for a sustained upward trajectory."

This announcement has injected new life into the stock, and it's evident in the pre-market trading where VZ has surged by almost 4%.   The current outlook for VZ is highly favorable, and here's why: A bullish divergence is emerging on both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators, particularly on the weekly timeframe. This divergence suggests that the stock is poised for a recovery, possibly leading to a profitable swing trade opportunity for investors.   Furthermore, VZ presents an additional allure for long-term investors. With a generous dividend yield of over 8%, this stock becomes a compelling choice for those seeking a stable, income-generating investment.   In summary, the combination of robust earnings, a notable increase in FCF guidance, and the promising technical indicators on the chart indicate a strong potential for VZ to recover from recent losses.

IF earnings brings us down to like 43, BUY.   IF earnings brings us up to 57-63, SELL.   There are only two really short term trends I could find, they both trend down. The rejection trend is quite strong, I expect this stock, if it tops out, to top out around 71. But it's hard to say at this exact moment. Tomorrow we will know more.   Be aware, there isn't much more room to the upside, but KO is a slow moving stock, so it could be a long way out. Long term projection is still bullish.   There is support at 52-50, and you could see a movement from that number. I'd expect the biggest movement to occur, should earnings take us really negative. I would start to favor the topside."

Many times there are strong support levels close to the current sold down price action.   The weekly charts also provide more data for day and swing traders to determine the all important RUN GAIN POTENTIAL. This must be calculated before any trade to determine the Risk versus Profit Potential for that trade, regardless of whether the hold time is a few minutes or several days for swing trading.   For many stocks, the recent selling down is not due to weaker earnings expectations but due to an overall reaction to retail news regarding international conflicts, US government uncertainties and regional wars.   The key element for trading stocks short-term is to understand where support will kick in and halt a sell short trade. Understanding the functionality and the strength or weakness of a support level is crucial to attaining a high-profit trade.   It is also a factor if you are waiting on the Dark Pool Buy Zone levels for getting into the stock for a run up from support levels.   Below is a chart of AMZN, which reports earnings on Thursday this week after the market close.   It shows that support is strong near the current price level. This indicates that the Dark Pool Buy Zone is within that technical price range. Selling short is inherently higher risk as the support level is a long-term trend strong support.   Why is it so strong?   1. There is a several-week price range that held the stock up.   2. Highs are a support mechanism when the stock market is not in a long-term downtrend. ALL   traders should know that this is not a bear market. Indexes are in a Trading Range.   3. The length of the candles is significant and relevant to the strength of the support."

Emotional Intelligence and Market Sentiment: Humans possess emotional intelligence, which can be advantageous in trading. Emotions can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and investor psychology. Human traders can gauge market sentiment by interpreting price movements, news sentiment, and market chatter. Understanding and incorporating market sentiment into decision-making can help traders identify potential market shifts and take advantage of sentiment-driven opportunities.   Contextual Understanding: Manual trading allows traders to have a deep contextual understanding of the markets they operate in. They can analyze broader economic factors, political developments, and industry-specific dynamics to assess the market environment accurately. This contextual understanding provides traders with a comprehensive view of the factors that can influence market movements, allowing for more informed decision-making.   Creative and Opportunistic Thinking: Human traders bring creative and opportunistic thinking to the trading process. They can spot unique opportunities that algorithms may not consider. By employing analytical skills, critical thinking, and out-of-the-box approaches, traders can identify unconventional trading strategies or undervalued assets that algorithms may overlook. This creative thinking allows traders to capitalize on market inefficiencies and generate returns.   Complex Market Conditions: Manual trading thrives in complex market conditions that algorithms may struggle to navigate. In situations where market dynamics are rapidly changing, volatile, or influenced by unpredictable events, human traders can adapt quickly and make decisions based on their judgment and expertise. The ability to think on their feet and adjust strategies accordingly enables traders to navigate challenging market conditions effectively.   Disadvantage of Manual Trading   Emotional Bias: Algo trading lacks human emotions, which can sometimes be a disadvantage. Human traders can analyze market conditions based on intuition and experience, while algorithms solely rely on historical data and predefined rules. Emotional biases, such as fear or greed, may play a role in decision-making, but algorithms cannot factor in these nuanced human aspects.   Time and Effort: Implementing and maintaining algo trading systems require time and effort. Developing effective algorithms and strategies demands significant technical expertise and resources. Traders need to continuously monitor and update their algorithms to ensure they remain relevant in changing market conditions. This ongoing commitment can be time-consuming and may require additional personnel or technical support.   Execution Speed: While algo trading is known for its speed, there can be challenges with execution. In fast-moving markets, delays in order execution can lead to missed opportunities or less favorable trade outcomes. Algo trading systems need to be equipped with high-performance infrastructure and reliable connectivity to execute trades swiftly and efficiently.   Information Overload: In today's digital age, vast amounts of data are available to traders. Algo trading systems can quickly process large volumes of information, but there is a risk of information overload. Filtering through excessive data and identifying relevant signals can be challenging. Traders must carefully design algorithms to focus on essential information and avoid being overwhelmed by irrelevant or noisy data.   The Power of AI in Enhancing Algorithmic Trading:   Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition: AI algorithms excel at processing vast amounts of data and recognizing patterns that may be difficult for human traders to identify.

Stop-loss orders, position sizing algorithms, and risk management rules can be integrated to protect against adverse market movements or unexpected news outcomes. This helps to minimize losses and ensure controlled risk exposure.   Flash Crash 2010: A Historic Market Event   On May 6, 2010, the financial markets experienced an unprecedented event known as the ""Flash Crash."" Within a matter of minutes, stock prices plummeted dramatically, only to recover shortly thereafter. This sudden and extreme market turbulence sent shockwaves through the financial world and highlighted the vulnerabilities of an increasingly interconnected and technology-driven trading landscape.   The Flash Crash Unfolds:   On that fateful day, between 2:32 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. EDT, the U.S. stock market experienced an abrupt and severe decline in prices. Within minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged nearly 1,000 points, erasing approximately $1 trillion in market value. Blue-chip stocks, such as Procter & Gamble and Accenture, saw their prices briefly crash to a mere fraction of their pre-crash values. This sudden and dramatic collapse was followed by a swift rebound, with prices largely recovering by the end of the trading session.   The Contributing Factors:   Several factors converged to create the perfect storm for the Flash Crash. One key element was the increasing prevalence of high-frequency trading (HFT), where computer algorithms execute trades at lightning-fast speeds. This automated trading, combined with the interconnectedness of markets, exacerbated the speed and intensity of the crash. Additionally, the widespread use of stop-loss orders, which are triggered when a stock reaches a specified price, amplified the selling pressure as prices rapidly declined. A lack of adequate market safeguards and regulatory mechanisms further exacerbated the situation.   Role of Algorithmic Trading:   Algorithmic trading played a significant role in the Flash Crash. As the markets rapidly declined, certain algorithmic trading strategies failed to function as intended, exacerbating the sell-off. These algorithms, designed to capture small price discrepancies, ended up engaging in a ""feedback loop"" of selling, pushing prices even lower. The speed and automation of algorithmic trading made it difficult for human intervention to effectively mitigate the situation in real-time.   Market Reforms and Lessons Learned:   The Flash Crash of 2010 prompted significant regulatory and technological reforms aimed at preventing similar events in the future. Measures included the implementation of circuit breakers, which temporarily halt trading during extreme price movements, and revisions to market-wide circuit breaker rules. Market surveillance and coordination between exchanges and regulators were also enhanced to better monitor and respond to unusual trading activity. Additionally, the incident highlighted the need for greater transparency and scrutiny of algorithmic trading practices.   Implications for Market Stability:   The Flash Crash served as a wake-up call to market participants and regulators, underscoring the potential risks associated with high-frequency and algorithmic trading. It highlighted the importance of ensuring that market infrastructure and regulations keep pace with technological advancements. The incident also emphasized the need for market participants to understand the intricacies of the trading systems they employ, and for regulators to continually evaluate and adapt regulatory frameworks to address emerging risks.   The Flash Crash of 2010 stands as a pivotal moment in financial market history, exposing vulnerabilities in the increasingly complex and interconnected world of electronic trading. The event triggered significant reforms and led to a greater focus on market stability, transparency, and risk management. While strides have been made to enhance market safeguards and regulatory oversight, ongoing vigilance and continuous adaptation to technological advancements are necessary to maintain the integrity and stability of modern financial markets.   How Algorithmic Trading Thrives in Changing Markets?   Algorithmic trading (ALGO) can tackle changing market conditions through various techniques and strategies that allow algorithms to adapt and respond effectively. Here are some ways ALGO can address changing market conditions:   Real-Time Data Analysis: Algo systems continuously monitor market data, including price movements, volume, news feeds, and economic indicators, in real-time. By analyzing this data promptly, algorithms can identify changing market conditions and adjust trading strategies accordingly. This enables Algo to capture opportunities and react to market shifts more rapidly than human traders.   Dynamic Order Routing: Algo systems can dynamically route orders to different exchanges or liquidity pools based on prevailing market conditions. By assessing factors such as liquidity, order book depth, and execution costs, algorithms can adapt their order routing strategies to optimize trade execution. This flexibility ensures that algo takes advantage of the most favorable market conditions available at any given moment.   Adaptive Trading Strategies: Algo can utilize adaptive trading strategies that are designed to adjust their parameters or rules based on changing market conditions. These strategies often incorporate machine learning algorithms to continuously learn from historical data and adapt to evolving market dynamics. By dynamically modifying their rules and parameters, algo systems can optimize trading decisions and capture opportunities across different market environments.   Volatility Management: Changing market conditions often come with increased volatility. Algo systems can incorporate volatility management techniques to adjust risk exposure accordingly. For example, algorithms may dynamically adjust position sizes, set tighter stop-loss levels, or modify risk management parameters based on current market volatility. These measures help to control risk and protect capital during periods of heightened uncertainty.   Pattern Recognition and Statistical Analysis: Algo systems can employ advanced pattern recognition and statistical analysis techniques to identify recurring market patterns or anomalies. By recognizing these patterns, algorithms can make informed trading decisions and adjust strategies accordingly. This ability to identify and adapt to patterns helps algocapitalize on recurring market conditions while also remaining adaptable to changes in market behavior.   Backtesting and Simulation: Algo systems can be extensively backtested and simulated using historical market data. By subjecting algorithms to various market scenarios and historical data sets, traders can evaluate their performance and robustness under different market conditions. This process allows for fine-tuning and optimization of algo strategies to better handle changing market dynamics.   In summary, algo tackles changing market conditions through real-time data analysis, dynamic order routing, adaptive trading strategies, volatility management, pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and rigorous backtesting. By leveraging these capabilities, algo can effectively adapt to evolving market conditions and capitalize on opportunities while managing risks more efficiently than traditional trading approaches   The Rise of Algo Traders: Is Technical Analysis Losing Ground?   Although algorithmic trading (algo trading) can automate and optimize certain elements   of technical analysis, it is improbable that it will fully substitute it. Technical analysis is a financial discipline that encompasses the examination of historical price and volume data, chart patterns, indicators, and other market variables to inform trading strategies. There are several reasons why algo traders cannot entirely supplant technical analysis:   Interpretation of Market Psychology: Technical analysis incorporates the understanding of market psychology, which is based on the belief that historical price patterns repeat themselves due to human behavior. It involves analyzing investor sentiment, trends, support and resistance levels, and other factors that can influence market movements. Algo traders may use technical indicators to identify these patterns, but they may not fully capture the nuances of market sentiment and psychological factors.   Subjectivity in Analysis: Technical analysis often involves subjective interpretation by traders, as different individuals may analyze the same chart or indicator differently. Algo traders rely on predefined rules and algorithms that may not encompass all the subjective elements of technical analysis. Human traders can incorporate their experience, intuition, and judgment to make nuanced decisions that may not be easily captured by algorithms.   Market Adaptability: Technical analysis requires the ability to adapt to changing market conditions and adjust strategies accordingly. While algorithms can be programmed to adjust certain parameters based on market data, they may not possess the same adaptability as human traders who can dynamically interpret and respond to evolving market conditions in real-time.   Unpredictable Events: Technical analysis is often challenged by unexpected events, such as geopolitical developments, economic announcements, or corporate news, which can cause significant market disruptions. Human traders may have the ability to interpret and react to these events based on their knowledge and understanding, while algo traders may struggle to respond effectively to unforeseen circumstances.   Fundamental Analysis: Technical analysis primarily focuses on price and volume data, while fundamental analysis considers broader factors such as company financials, macroeconomic indicators, industry trends, and news events. Algo traders may not have the capacity to analyze fundamental factors and incorporate them into their decision-making process, which can limit their ability to fully replace technical analysis.   In conclusion, while algo trading can automate certain elements of technical analysis, it is unlikely to replace it entirely. Technical analysis incorporates subjective interpretation, market psychology, adaptability, and fundamental factors that may be challenging for algorithms to fully replicate. Human traders with expertise in technical analysis and the ability to interpret market dynamics will continue to play a significant role in making informed trading decisions.   The Ultimate Winner - Algo Trading or Manual Trading?   Determining whether algo trading or manual trading is best depends on various factors, including individual preferences, trading goals, and skill sets. Both approaches have their advantages and limitations, and what works best for one person may not be the same for another. Let's compare the two:   Speed and Efficiency: Algo trading excels in speed and efficiency, as computer algorithms can analyze data and execute trades within milliseconds. Manual trading involves human decision-making, which may be subject to cognitive biases and emotional factors, potentially leading to slower execution or missed opportunities.   Emotion and Discipline: Algo trading eliminates emotional biases from trading decisions, as algorithms follow predefined rules without being influenced by fear or greed. Manual trading requires discipline and emotional control to make objective decisions, which can be challenging for some traders.   Adaptability: Algo trading can quickly adapt to changing market conditions and execute trades based on pre-programmed rules. Manual traders can adapt their strategies as well, but it may require more time and effort to monitor and adjust to rapidly evolving market dynamics.   Complexity and Technical Knowledge: Algo trading requires programming skills or the use of algorithmic platforms, which can be challenging for traders without a technical background. Manual trading, on the other hand, relies on an understanding of fundamental and technical analysis, which requires continuous learning and analysis of market trends.   Strategy Development: Algo trading allows for systematic and precise strategy development based on historical data analysis and backtesting. Manual traders can develop their strategies as well, but it may involve more subjective interpretations of charts, patterns, and indicators.   Risk Management: Both algo trading and manual trading require effective risk management. Algo trading can incorporate predetermined risk management parameters into algorithms, whereas manual traders need to actively monitor and manage risk based on their judgment.   Ultimately, the best approach depends on individual circumstances. Some traders may prefer algo trading for its speed, efficiency, and objective decision-making, while others may enjoy the flexibility and adaptability of manual trading. It is worth noting that many traders use a combination of both approaches, utilizing algo trading for certain strategies and manual trading for others.   In conclusion, algorithmic trading offers benefits such as speed, efficiency, and risk management, while manual trading provides adaptability and human intuition. AI enhances algorithmic trading by processing data, recognizing patterns, and providing decision support. Algos excel in automated news monitoring and event-driven strategies. However, the Flash Crash of 2010 exposed vulnerabilities in the interconnected trading landscape, with algorithmic trading exacerbating the market decline. It serves as a reminder to implement appropriate safeguards and risk management measures. Overall, a balanced approach that combines the strengths of both algorithmic and manual trading can lead to more effective and resilient trading strategies."

2023-10-24 12:19:30,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/ESMT/6AUfqED9-Big-acquisition-News-Is-Sending-EngageSmart-Stock-Higher/,"EngageSmart (ESMT 11.88%) is seeing big gains in Todays trading. The software specialist's share price was up 12% few hours. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.   EngageSmart published a press release before the market opened this morning that it was on track to be acquired by Vista Equity and bought out for approximately $4 billion, working out to a price of $23 per share.   EngageSmart is poised to be bought in an all-cash deal Vista Equity's buyout price of $23 per share for EngageSmart represented a 14% premium compared to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) specialist's valuation at Friday's market close. The all-cash deal is expected to close in next year's first quarter. Based on EngageSmart's current share price, investors who bought the stock right now would see a gain of approximately 1.6% upon the buyout's completion.   Is now the time to buy EngageSmart stock? The chances of any antitrust issues blocking the acquisition are seemingly nonexistent. While it's very likely that Vista Equity will complete its buyout, now is not the time to buy EngageSmart stock. If you already own the stock, now could be a good time to take profits.   At its current price, EngageSmart offers minimal upside. On the other hand, the stock could see substantial sell-offs in the unlikely event that the buyout were to be called off or delayed.   The deal will almost certainly be completed, but investors can probably put their money to better use. Low-risk bonds and some savings accounts can provide similar or better rates of return with far lower downside risk. So even investors who are looking for small, short-term gains have better options at their disposal right now."
2023-10-24 01:35:19,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/ARM/pTrjtVtW-Patent-Expirations-And-Competition-May-Limit-ARM-s-Market-Share/,"Key points   1. ARM is a leader with a saturated number of customers limiting future growth.   Its in a highly competitive landscape and needs to innovate beyond patent expirations in the 2030s.   2. As a controlled entity of SoftBank, I expect the board to push for buybacks in a bid to maximize returns.   3. I expect SoftBank to slowly unload its stake, while ARM buys back their stock - this may initially sustain the price.   Prospects Are Still Solid After IPO   ARM designs and licenses processors to manufacturers, it is the engineering company behind the worlds CPUs.   About 70% of the worlds population uses Arm-based products. More than 30 billion ARM-based chips (smartphones, small electronics, data centers, networking equipment) were shipped in FY '23, representing an approximately 70% increase since 2016.   Most of ARMs IP sales are in the United States, however a good combined portion are in East Asia, including China (PRC), Taiwan and South Korea.   The business model of the company is to design ARM-chips and license them out to manufacturers. It sells the intellectual property behind chips, but doesnt produce the hardware. This is an engineering-first company, with approximately 80% of global employees focused on research, design, and innovation. The company reaches scale with the ability to license out each CPU product to multiple companies.   ARM is a high performing company, with a gross margin of 80% and operating margins of 25%. The company made $2.7 billion in revenues in 2022 that stagnated in the IPO year.   Despite stagnating in its IPO year, its future prospects from here are still solid as demand for their IP continue to grow. But I dont believe itll grow revenues as fast as analysts are expecting (14% per year).   ARMs Market Share May Suffer As Patents Expire   Arm has an addressable market of $202.5 billion, and expects it to grow at a 6.8% annual rate to $246.6 billion by the end of 2025. The company estimates the aggregate value of chips containing Arm technology to be approx. $98.9 billion in 2022, representing 48.9% market share.   This market share is large even for a market leader. Competitors and expiring patents can become significant forces driving down the market share for ARM in the future. Notably most of the key ARM patents are expected to expire in the 2030s:   The expiration of these patents can open the door for more companies to design and manufacture ARM-based chips.   Limited New Customer Growth, But Opportunities in Smart Devices   More than 260 companies reported that they had shipped Arm-based chips in 2023, including:   Mobile computing: Apple, Guangdong OPPO, Samsung, Vivo Mobile, Xiaomi.   Cloud computing: AWS and Alibaba   Industrial IoT: Cruise and Mercedes-Benz, Raspberry Pi, Schneider Electric, and Siemens.   ARM also entered into a long-term agreement with Apple that extends beyond 2040 allowing the company to use Arm architecture for their CPUs.   The customer base for ARM is well established, and the company is at a phase where it will have a harder time acquiring new customers, rather it will have to rely on industry growth and innovation in order to increase revenue.   One of the highest-potential growth avenues for ARM is the smart devices vertical. ARMs CPU architecture fits well in small devices, giving it an advantage over peers with larger CPUs. As compute power increases, it will become more practical for consumers to rely on mobile devices and wearables instead of larger devices for everyday needs, this has the potential to widen the TAM.   Another growth avenue for the company is the market adoption of electronically rich vehicles and EVs as well as the capitalizing on government programs subsidizing EVs. Vehicles have an increasing number of processing demands both in central systems, and IoT linked sensors.   Selling Pressure From SoftBank May Limit Price Appreciation   ARM is a controlled entity owned by SoftBank Group with approximately 90.6% of their outstanding ordinary shares following the completion ARMs IPO.   Arms Top Shareholders   ARMs IPO is pushed by SoftBank who is looking to cash-in on their investment or escape with minimal losses. One scenario is to expect a continuous selling from SoftBank, which means that there may be selling pressure for some time keeping price appreciation moderate until the stock flips to a diversified investor base."
2023-10-24 01:25:46,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/ABNB/DE1aDOro-Airbnb-NASDAQ-ABNB-Worth-Watching/,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.   Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.   Airbnb's Improving Profits   In the last three years Airbnb's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Airbnb's EPS catapulted from US$1.98 to US$3.60, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 82% year-on-year growth like that.   Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Airbnb shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 19% to 22% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.   Are Airbnb Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?   We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$80b company like Airbnb. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$23b. Coming in at 29% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.   While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Airbnb, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.   The Airbnb CEO received total compensation of just US$311k in the year to December 2022. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.   Is Airbnb Worth Keeping An Eye On?   Airbnb's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Airbnb is worth considering carefully. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Airbnb by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry."
2023-10-24 00:32:02,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/V/l8LPdRxA-VISA-Poised-For-Greatness/,"Visa processes more than $11.6 trillion in gross dollar volume (GDV), made up primarily of digital payments with the remainder being things like ATM withdrawals, B2B transactions, etc. Alongside Mastercard, which is en-route to process $9.2 trillion, this makes Visa one of the two largest payment processors in the world. The company evidently has a wide moat that is targeted by competitors and regulators.   While many competitors such as Block (SQ) and Paypal (PYPL) seek to penetrate the high-margin space, Visa is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of digital payments and serve as a foundation for digital transactions with a wide moat that can be difficult to substitute.   Digital payments, a core part of Visas transaction value, are estimated (2) to reach a $9.5 trillion GDV in 2023, and grow to $12 trillion in 2025.   The Credit Card Competition Act May Be A Major Negative Catalyst   Acknowledging that the passing of this act is not a given, investors may see a large portion of the profits of payment processors like Visa wiped out should this law pass. In its current proposition, the legislation would enable merchants to choose an alternative payment processor (one that isnt Visa or Mastercard) to execute payments for their customers.   Merchants instead of customers are the ones covering payment processing fees, so they have a large incentive to route payments to the cheapest competitor. Inevitably, Visa will be forced to lower their payment fees to compete with these cheaper alternatives, thereby compromising a key income stream.   Large companies like Walmart and Amazon will especially benefit from this change as they stand to reduce the fees paid to processors like Visa and Mastercard.   I estimate that this bill or a compromised version of it will pass, and erode Visas oligopolistic moat, and therefore their margins and net profits.   Visa Will Only Capture 30% of Serviceable Addressable Market   In 2021, the US value of non-cash payments was estimated to be over $128.51 trillion   I estimate a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of $100 trillion to $150 trillion, based off data from the US plus the rest of the world.   But I think that a more realistic Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM - What Visas share of the TAM could be) for Visa is between $50 trillion and $75 trillion.   Alternative data estimates indicate that the global SAM for card networks will grow to $60 trillion in 2027. Of the SAM midpoint of $62.5 trillion by 2028, I estimate that Visa manages to capture 30% resulting in a GDV of $18.75 trillion.   Visa had a take rate of about 0.2247% for the last 9 months, up 9.4% YoY from 0.2054%. Assuming Visa captures my estimated GDV of $18.75 trillion, the revenue in 2028 comes up to $42.2 billion (5.8% CAGR revenue growth)   As most of the developed world already prefers cards, Visa will find it more difficult to open up international markets, so I expect the company to reach this high-point.   The International Segment Is A Primary Revenue & Growth Driver   Much of Visas growth comes from international markets, and there are two key verticals to watch for the company: e-commerce and B2B cross-border payments which is very pivotal VISA.   E-commerce is growing rapidly, and Visa is the leading payment processor for online transactions, making it well-positioned to capture this growing market.   Visa is also expanding into business-to-business (B2B) payments and cross-border payments. These markets have a lot of potential, and Visa is investing heavily to capitalize on these opportunities."

2023-10-23 23:46:09,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/USO/jYaBuVgI-Oil-Leading-Dollar-Lower-Watch-Oil/,"Rising yields have lead to a massive sell-off in OIL markets foreshadowing: tighter economic conditions, cheaper energy prices and lower inflation prints - ultimately resulting in a weaker dollar / stronger euro in the short term. Globally inflation took off mainly as a result of covid stimulus exacerbated by Russias invasion of Ukraine. Even though the war is far from over the supply chain kinks / export bans caused from it are mainly resolved. Lower natural gas prices result in cheaper fertilizer and food. Cheaper oil reduces manufacturing and transportation costs. Higher yields and higher energy prices are a cure for themselves.   If a Dollar pullback / Euro rally is expected, a rally in risk assets will ensue. Lower inflation leads to greater speculation of a soft landing ultimately resulting in softer economic conditions - beneficial for risk assets. I believe Oil has shown the markets hand and is notifying us of weakness in yields/dollar. Gold may look to breakout of its 3 year range between $1600-$2000.  A return to pre-war levels for the dollar will give Gold and risk assets a boost. On a longer time period, I remain bearish EURO / bullish Dollar in the long term as I believe the economy remains resilient elevating inflation into next - dispelling the soft landing scenario.

2023-10-23 19:41:31,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/RSP/ctHzbhbl-SPX-Balance-of-Power/,"Not all is equal. And nothing is static.   Entropy is the foundation of our world, and it is the bane of a rich man's existence.   You collect in one spot, then nature comes up and spreads your work around.   Entropy is the unbeatable power of justice. In the end entropy always wins.   One has limited amount of time to temporary evade it.   Panta Rhei - Heraclitus   Everything flows. Money just like water, tends to move around. It is what it is meant to do.   Rich men need poor ones to collect from. In the end, there is nothing else to collect from the poorer ones. But the cycle must continue. No rich man could ever possibly give out wealth for free. Instead, they let nature do its trick and rebalance things.   I will now try to make a rough model of the changes in markets. Divide markets in distinct periods so as to have a better understanding on the progress of a bull market.   Energy Conservation   Money and entropy tend to spread out. When the stock market was ""invented"", few had the stocks and many had the money. Trading is a way to manipulate entropy to our advantage. We let nature spread what we don't need, and as a repayment we accumulate what we need. The stock market is like a   free energy machine   .   The invention of the stock market resulted in a massive wealth transfer, and ended with a painful crash; The Great Depression. The peak of the Roaring '20s was the peak of wealth accumulation from the few.   In the post-Great-Depression economy, money spread out again. From the few to the many.   In these decades, DJI (the big 30) stagnated while SPX (the 500) progressively got stronger.   But the big-30 had an ace up their sleve.   In trading the game must always go on. There is always a way to get richer.   And so, commodities became the new place for wealth to accumulate to.   From all of the above we have come to realize that bubble tops come when the few have accumulated the maximum possible from the many. DJI/SPX measures oligarchy, while the inverse SPX/DJI measures democracy in the spread of wealth in stocks.   Many bubbles and many crashes have followed after the Great Depression. The .com bubble crash and the GFC are memorable to young and old alike. And they all exhibit the same base structure. It is all the same, with one crucial difference.   The 2020 economy is vastly different from the 1920 economy.   The role of SPX and DJI has changed in the last few decades. DJI used to represent the companies that shaped bubbles and SPX the ones that followed. Now NDX and SPX are the indices that represent fast growth while DJI has taken the role of the ""index of stability"".   The modern balance-of-power measure is the following:   SPX-equal-weight divided by SPX-market-cap.   www.tradingview.com/...ven-off-at-the-pass/   Since I couldn't find an SPX-equal-weight index in TradingView, I have constructed a similar chart using two ETFs, RSP and IVV. The RSP/IVV chart is a good analogue to the standard chart.   And so, where do we conclude?   After much analysis we can say the following in retrospect.   The 2008 bubble was quick but with big repercussions.   Money democracy shows signs of impeding financial weakness.   And as for the post-2009 Bull Market...   We realize that it progressively turns into a bubble. While there is no definitive way to ""normalize"" SPX, SPX/M2SL proves a good candidate for absolute SPX cost.   Yield rates tell many tales.   Usually yield rates increase as the wide economy needs them. Strong economies need a lot of money and they can withstand high yield rates. And contrary to popular belief, yield rates are   positively   correlated with yield rates. Now however, the wide economy refuses to absorb such high yield rates. High production cost and high rates can destabilize the economy.   Money Democracy is Positively Correlated to Yield Rates.   Now we witness the wide economy refuse to absorb these yields.   This has resulted in unprecedented wealth accumulation from the few.   Speculation Chart:   While this type of analysis is subjective, it is interesting to see patterns repeat.   Composite Chart:   An experimental chart attempts to calculate the scale of the derivative bubble we are in.   We realize that equity prices are now lying. They are simply too inflated and riddled with derivatives to believe in.   All of that was quite complex to follow through, and even harder to make a conclusion.   In the end, the simplest analysis might be the best.   A massive bearish upward channel has formed. Now price has rejected once again off the ceiling. The real recession may have not even started yet...   Tread lightly, for this is hallowed ground.   -Father Grigori   Bonus Charts:   Have we reached a golden ceiling?"

I get it. Today, it trades for below even its IPO price.   But the reason why I think it's an AI play ready to double, possibly triple, is a fundamental reason that I'll explain in this post.   First of all, let me state something very interesting about Bandwidth - today it's one of the worst performing stocks in the entire market since 2020 and 2021. I don't entirely know why that's the case, but I do think the market has overreacted.   Let me now get the bad news out of the way: when BAND's stock was flying high, management took out several large loans to expand faster and grow globally. Those gains are starting to be realized, but it's key to mention this as the debt profile is still somewhat high. The question now is: can they keep paying it off? They're on target to have little to no debt within the next few years.   Okay, so why is Bandwidth an AI play? To understand this you need to know that Bandwidth is essentially the connector for data that is transmitted over the web. Bandwidth's platform helps data, messages, voice calls, video calls, email, and more travel from Point A to Point B.   For example, when you make a call on Zoom or even Slack or Google Hangouts, it's highly likely your call is being routed over Bandwith's network. The point is, Bandwidth is the toll keeper, the train conductor, for most modern communications that are triggered at scale.   So how does AI fit into this?   That's where this gets good. All of these AI companies NEED a company to help deliver the information to their end consumer. If OpenAI creates a chatbot that works on text message or sends push notifications or can even speak over calls, Bandwidth will most likely be the resource that delivers that information from business to consumer.   What's even more interesting is call centers and the future of talking to call centers to get help or support. In one scenario, you upload all your most frequently asked questions, pair it with an AI service, and then let users call that AI service over the Bandwidth network and now an AI customer support agent is solving issues at scale.   This is just one example.   I could go on and on.   But that's my play!   I own a little Bandwidth and will be watching closely in the coming years."

It's expressed as a percentage of sales.   Tesla has lowered its product sales price 5 times in 2023, as of October 25, 2023.   Here is a timeline of Tesla's price cuts in 2023:   January 19: Tesla lowered the price of the Model 3 and Model Y by $1,000 each.   March 7: Tesla lowered the price of the Model 3 and Model Y by an additional $2,000 each.   April 7: Tesla lowered the price of the Model S and Model X by $5,000 each.   August 4: Tesla lowered the price of the Model 3 and Model Y by an additional $3,000 each.   October 5: Tesla lowered the price of the Model 3 and Model Y again, with the Model 3 now starting at $42,990 and the Model Y starting at $52,990.   all these leads to lower revenue:   These price cuts have made Tesla's vehicles more affordable and accessible to consumers. They have also helped Tesla to maintain its market leadership position in the electric vehicle market.   Tesla (TSLA) would be particularly vulnerable to a combination of quantitative tightening (QT) and recession. QT is the process of the Federal Reserve reducing the size of its balance sheet, which means selling bonds and other assets. This can lead to higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, which can hurt demand for big-ticket items like electric vehicles.   A recession would also be a major blow to Tesla, as consumers would likely tighten their spending and delay or cancel purchases of new cars. In addition, Tesla is still ramping up production at its new factories in Texas and Germany, and a recession could make it more difficult to meet its production targets.   Here are some specific ways in which a combination of QT and recession could hurt Tesla:   Higher interest rates would make it more expensive for consumers to finance Tesla vehicles. Tesla has relied on strong leasing demand to drive sales growth, but this could be hit hard if interest rates rise significantly.   Tighter financial conditions could make it more difficult for Tesla to raise capital. Tesla has ambitious plans to expand its production capacity and product lineup, but it will need to raise a significant amount of money to do so. If financial conditions tighten, it could be more difficult and expensive for Tesla to borrow money.   A recession would lead to lower demand for Tesla vehicles. Tesla vehicles are still relatively expensive, so consumers are more likely to delay or cancel purchases of a Tesla if they are facing financial difficulties.   A recession could disrupt Tesla's supply chain. Tesla relies on a global network of suppliers for its components. A recession could lead to disruptions in this supply chain, which could make it difficult for Tesla to produce vehicles.   Overall, a combination of QT and recession would be a major challenge for Tesla. The company would need to find ways to reduce costs, increase demand, and secure financing in order to weather the storm.   If you think Cathie Wood's prediction will be right, look at this:   Conclusion:   TSLA could go down to pre-pandemic level by the end of 2024"

Those announcements include a new compute platform, called Snapdragon X Elite; a new central processing unit chip, called the Qualcomm Oryon CPU; and a new smartphone chip, named the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.   Though Qualcomm makes chips, it doesn't produce the sought-after GPUs that have become standard for training AI models. That field is dominated by Nvidia (NVDA), though players like Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) are racing to catch up amid the GPU shortage.   Qualcomm, throughout the AI boom, has sought to carve out a niche that's linked to mobile and about increasing efficiency. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, Qualcomm's mobile platform for Android smartphones, was designed to emphasize generative AI  for example, offering the ability to run large language models, like Meta's (META) Llama 2.   The chip will begin appearing in major Android devices over the next few weeks, and will also bring enhanced gaming and audio features.   The company's Snapdragon X Elite compute platform is designed to give Windows computers an AI boost. Devices with Snapdragon X Elite aren't set to launch until the middle of 2024  but the platform will feature a new chip that Qualcomm is expected to emphasize moving forward, the Qualcomm Oryon CPU.   According to Qualcomm, the Oryon CPU is faster than Arm-based (ARM) competitors, a group that includes Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Samsung, and TSMC. The chip purportedly matches the peak performances of both Apple's (AAPL) M2 chip and Intel's 13980Hx, with less power.   The product is an implicit shot at AMD and a multilayered stab at Intel, both of which use Arm intellectual property in some of their chips.

""Although we like Qualcomm's potential to diversify over time, we are wary of its position given structural share loss across the Android ecosystem.""   Qualcomm's partnership with Apple is also vital to its near-term prospects  and fragile, as Apple has chipmaking ambitions of its own. In September, Qualcomm and Apple re-upped an iPhone deal that sent Qualcomm's shares surging.   ""The deal marks a second time that Apple has had to strike a multiyear contract to source thin modems from Qualcomm, in a contractual relationship that Apple sees as unfair but necessary,"" Argus Research director Jim Kelleher wrote in September. ""For Qualcomm, the agreement locks up a key high-volume customer at a time when financial pressures and modest gains in smartphone function and efficiency are limiting demand for new phones."""

2023-10-25 16:42:39,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/SNAP/I5vvIJY3-Snap-Stock-Surges-More-Than-11-After-Earnings-Beat/,"Snap (SNAP) reported its third quarter earnings Tuesday after the bell, beating estimates of the top and bottom lines and suggesting that more growth for the social messaging company may be on the horizon.   These earnings beats were a much-needed win. Snap, owner of Snapchat, has become representative of the malaise that can affect an advertising-dependent tech company. The business has struggled since the launch of Apple's (AAPL) App Transparency Tracking, and was sent reeling by a digital advertising slowdown that's only just picking up again.   Many of Snap's plans for its future  for example, its repeated efforts to make mainstream AR glasses  have yet to fully take. The company this year released its own AI chatbot, My AI, but its rollout has reportedly raised fears among parents concerned for their children's safety.   In its earnings release, Snap revealed that over 200 million people have used My AI, sending more than 20 billion messages. It has also signed up 5 million people for its premium subscription Snapchat+, adding a potential annual income of more than $200 million.   We are focused on improving our advertising platform to drive higher return on investment for our advertising partners, and we have evolved our go-to-market efforts to better serve our partners and drive customer success,"" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.   Additionally, Snap offered up a relatively optimistic internal forecast, saying that it sees its Q4 adjusted EBITDA coming in between $65 million and $105 million, a wide range but on the high end from Wall Street's estimates of $100.6 million. Notably, this was not formal guidance; Snap is opting to disclose internal guidance, which should be viewed with some caution.   The Earnings Rundown   Here are the key numbers that Snap reported, compared to Wall Street's expectations as compiled by Bloomberg:   Adjusted Earnings Per Share: $0.02 actual versus -$0.04 expected   Revenue: $1.19 billion actual versus $1.11 billion expected   Global Daily Active Users (DAUs): 406 million actual versus 405.79 million expected   Snap's daily active user numbers are particularly notable  they mark growth of 12% year over year.   Snap COO Jerry Hunter is set to retire, the company revealed in its report. Snap also authorized a share buyback program up to $500 million, implying that management thinks the company's stock is undervalued.   Snap shares came into this earnings cycle up about 9% year to date, lagging the Nasdaq Internet Index, which is up about 34% in 2023. Its revenue had declined in the last two quarters before the latest reversal.   Despite the upswing in Snap's revenue and signals that the advertising market is recovering, the company's investor letter acknowledged that the third quarter was tough. Looking ahead, there are also fears of another advertising downturn due to the war in Israel."

Microsoft has made AI a cornerstone of its business over the last year, announcing a massive $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and unveiling generative AI-enhanced versions of its Bing search engine and Edge browser in February.   Since then, the company has launched various generative AI-powered Copilot apps for Outlook, Windows 11, and Microsoft 365.

In addition to its massive focus on AI capabilities, Microsoft recently closed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The deal is the largest in Microsofts history and instantly makes it the third-largest video game company in the world by revenue behind Tencent and Sony.

""Matson's Ocean Transportation and Logistics business segments continued to perform well despite a challenging business environment and relatively difficult economic conditions impacting the U.S. consumer,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Matt Cox. ""Within Ocean Transportation, our China service experienced solid freight demand despite the muted peak season in the Transpacific trade lane but generated lower year-over-year volume and freight rates, which were the primary contributors to the year-over-year decline in our consolidated operating income.   Currently in the Transpacific market place, we continue to see a reduction of deployed capacity in light of lower volumes as a result of lower consumer demand for retail goods. Absent an economic 'hard landing' in the U.S., we expect trade dynamics in 2024 to be comparable to 2023as consumer-related spending activity is expected to remain stable. Regardless of the economic backdrop, we expect to continue to earn a significant rate premium to the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index reflecting our fast and reliable ocean services and unmatched destination services."""

Tehcnicly it is possible we have either bottomed, OR will bottom in the very near future.   From an elliott wave perspective I have 2 scenarios, where scenario one assumes we have already bottomed in the consolidation zone down around 1 USD. (Even if we have not bottomed, we gonna get a bigger ABC-or WXY correction possibly reaching at least the 1:1 target).   It is possible (but not guaranteed) we have put in the first subwave 1 as a leading diagonal (expanding rising wedge), where we have moved in 3 counts in each wave as an abc (watch for extended trading hours!!!).   We could argue where is the white wave 1 top - either we had an overshooting b wave and the yellow c wave already bottomed as well (possible), OR the b wave currently forming and will followed by the yellow c wave down, but keeping the higher low overall.   I am scaling in slowly on the pullbacks for now with the stoploss just under 1.00 USD. Since it is a leading diagonal at best, we cannot really trust it until it proves itself. I am waiting to see a more defined abc pullback structure for now, support areas are added.   Overall we have just danced around the 200day MA, 180day MA provided support, all the other moving averages (9/21/50) are below us, in case pullback coming possibly giving as more support. Daily RSI and MACD turning upside, selloff slowing down, and about to diverge (already in convergence). Weekly datas getting stronger (RSI/MACD), and currently we are above the defined baseline, which will also possibly provide support on pullbacks. Whoever like formations, seemingly we are forming a bigger falling wedge (bullish), even is the lows not in YET (then it is quiet near probably). Also, it is not uncommon that if wave 2 have finished and starting/started the white wave 3, will form some kind of inverse head and shoulders, watch for that as a little confirmation (still not guarantee).   Overall I think it has a good chance now to bottom and start an upside cycle."

Shares rose more than 5% in early trading Wednesday as the bottom-line results topped analysts' expectations and the company raised its guidance for 2023 free cash flow by $1 billion, to $18 billion.   Earning per share fell to $1.13 from $1.17 in the prior year quarter, if you don't take out about a $579 million hit from TracFone and shutting its BlueJeans business, among others. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $1.22, lower than the year ago quarter but higher than analyst expectations compiled by Visible Alpha at $1.18.   Revenue also fell by 2.6% year-over-year to $33.3 billion due to lower wireless equipment revenue and fewer upgrades by postpaid customers.   Verizon saw 434,000 net additions for its broadband service, up 15% from the same period last year. Consumer wireless business revenue grew 2.9% to $15.96 billion on the back of fixed wireless additions, even as both postpaid and retail wireless subscribers tapered. Wireless business customers helped offset some of the company's continued struggle to maintain users in its wireline division.   The broader communication services sector has this year regained much of the ground it lost as the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 last year.   The benchmark S&P 500 Communication Services Select Sector Index is up more than 33% in the 12 months leading to Oct. 24, 2023.   Last week, AT&T announced better-than-expected earnings results and 468,000 new postpaid phone subscribers, a sharp improvement over the most recent quarter.   Verizon shares have fallen roughly 12% in the last year and have lost about half their value since reaching a high above $60 per share in late 2019. But still kept its levels high."

If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, from a first glance at Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.   Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?   Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)  (Total Assets -   Current Liabilities) 0.09 = CN126b  (CN1.8t - CN380b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).   Thus, Alibaba Group Holding has an ROCE of 9.0%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's   around the 10% average generated by the Multiline Retail industry.   What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us   There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Alibaba Group   Holding. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 9.0% and the   business has deployed 121% more capital into its operations. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire   confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the   business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.   Long story short, while Alibaba Group Holding has been reinvesting its capital, the returns   that it's generating haven't increased. Since the stock has declined 44% over the last five   years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. In any case, the   stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're   looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."

We cover Palantir for over a year now, and the stock has been trading downwards ever since. Because of the whole bear market last year, which hit technology stocks especially hard, bullish signals couldnt be observed in this stock.   However, since the new year Palantir could steadily build up momentum and managed to gain almost +23% since the significant low @5.92$. We estimate that the whole bearish count has finally come to an end, and it is very likely that 2023 is going to be a lot better for Palantir than 2022!   From a technical perspective we can clearly say, that Palantir finished three bearish waves, which are marked in orange (iv), red 4 and in purple (4). The last wave down formed a very common chart structure, which is known as the ending diagonal. In such chart structures, a wave 3 is mostly very short and wave 1 seems to be very big in comparison to the other waves. The price action in Palantir really depends on how the Nasdaq will perform in the following weeks, currently the whole market seems to recover, and we are confident that Palantir will profit from this.   Investors who are interested in this company and who dont already hold stocks can use this opportunity to accumulate in our marked zone. (9.63$ - 5.13$)   We currently cover a microcount which can be seen below, as many investors who are familiar with Elliot waves know  micro counting is very speculative. We are going to monitor Palantir very closely in the next weeks and if investors on here are interested in this company we could post updates about it more frequently.   In our microcount we are currently in wave (v) in green. The wave (v) should push the price into the orange Fibonacci zone ranging from $7.24-$7.70, overshooting is possible. After this the price should go into a small wave 2 correction,   we will calculate a new buy zone for wave 2.   Please note that we are already invested in Palantir with 2 positions, which we announced last year. If Palantir manages to establish a minor bullish wave 1  wave 2 we will decide to acquire another position   Long #1 (Announced 21.03.2022)   AVERAGE EXECUTION PRICE: 12.53$   STOP-LOSS: NONE   LONGTERM TARGET: +80$   Long #2 (Announced 09.05.2022)   AVERAGE EXECUTION PRICE: 7.59$   STOP-LOSS: NONE   LONGTERM TARGET: +80$"

The trailing P/E ratio is 20.92 and the forward P/E ratio is 14.11, indicating a relatively moderate valuation. The price-to-earnings (PEG) ratio is 1.185.   Conclusion   The analysis suggests that FleetCor Technologies is on a positive trajectory of steady revenue growth and investor optimism. Technical analysis also suggests that the stock has the potential to move higher, but entry points should be carefully considered to minimize risk. Analyst ratings and a target price for the stock indicate a positive outlook, though the stock's valuation may be a concern for some investors."

2023-10-24 19:41:31,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NWS/nPQqL7V5-NWSA/,"News Corporation (Ticker: NWSA), a diversified media and information services entity, has exhibited mixed signals in recent financial reports. Here's an encapsulated analysis touching upon its financial performance alongside technical indicators as of recent data:   Financial Performance:   Q4 FY 2023:   Revenue: Reported at $2.43 billion, marking a 9% dip compared to $2.67 billion in the same quarter last fiscal year. The decline accounts for a $110 million (4%) benefit from an additional week in the prior year quarter and a $72 million (3%) hit from foreign currency fluctuations.   Q3 FY 2023:   The company unveiled its financials for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, although specifics werent detailed in the snippet.   Q2 FY 2023:   Revenue: Stood at $2.52 billion, a 7% slide compared to $2.72 billion YoY.   Technical Analysis:   On the daily chart, the stock is currently navigating through a corrective wave zone. Short-term upward momentum seems to have topped with the peak of corrective wave B at around $22.62, post which a C wave correction is anticipated. The MACD indicator clearly underscores this, showing the upward momentum is waning, and a bearish crossover is on the horizon. The RSI indicator displayed overbought signals post the price touching above $23.   Advisory:   Combining both fundamental and technical analysis, the advisory leans towards a wait-and-watch stance currently. The suggestion is to eye for a price retrace to $20, followed by a rebound surpassing the previous 5th impulse wave, i.e., $23, before considering entry."
2023-10-24 19:21:22,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/HRL/4g0Oe4oi-HRL/,"Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL), a distinguished brand in the food processing sector, has been under the lens of investors and traders alike due to its recent price actions. A meticulous examination of the technical charts reveals a narrative of a stock at a critical juncture, hinting at a potential momentum shift in the near term.   Fundamental Analysis:   In Q3 2023, HRL reported a quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share, falling short of the consensus estimate of $0.41 per share. The stock faces challenges stemming from a volatile, complex, and high-cost operating environment, with specific weakness noted in the International segment. Despite Hormel Foods' steady market presence and dividend payout, the stock's performance is hampered by operational challenges and missed earnings estimates. The analysts' hold rating indicates a neutral outlook with potential upside if the company can address its highlighted challenges and achieve its strategic targets.   Technical Analysis:   Currently, HRL is stationed at a key support level on the weekly chart, with critical support price lingering around $30. The structure unveils a complete reverse impulse wave, indicating that the stock is at the tail end of the 5th wave. Should the stock find support at S1, a price retracement could be imminent, marking the initiation of a new wave cycle. The RSI indicator delineates that the price has entered a pronounced oversold phase, traditionally a precursor to a trend reversal. However, the extremities in the RSI readings necessitate a cautious approach, as a premature entry could lead to a drawdown if the price continues to plummet. The MACD, a trend-following momentum indicator, has yet to showcase a significant reversal pattern, suggesting that the bearish momentum is still intact. A prudent approach would be to await stabilization at S1, followed by a corrective wave B, before considering an entry. This strategy aims to mitigate the risk associated with catching a falling knife while capitalizing on the potential upside once the trend reversal is confirmed.   Entry Strategy:   A conservative tactic would be to await stabilization at S1, trailed by a corrective wave B, before contemplating an entry. This strategy is devised to lessen the risk associated with catching a falling knife while capitalizing on the potential upside once the trend reversal is substantiated.   This analysis seeks to provide a holistic insight into HRL's potential future price movement, grounded in both technical and fundamental analysis. The confluence of support levels, wave structure, and momentum indicators coupled with the companys fundamental outlook paints a picture of cautious optimism, albeit with a recommendation of a well-thought-out entry strategy to navigate the inherent market risks."

On Friday, China's central bank announced a fine of 7.12 billion yuan, or $985 million, for Ant Group the fintech giant co-founded by Ma that operates the Alipay payments app signaling that its years-long regulatory crackdown is ending.   But the years-long crackdown has taken a heavy toll on Ma's wealth and the market valuations of the companies he holds stakes in. Alibaba the flagship company he cofounded saw a 45%, or $620 billion, drop in market value since shares hit their peak in 2020, per Bloomberg's calculations on Sunday.   Ant Group is now valued at around $78.5 billion marking a steep 75% discount to its valuation of $315 billion in a scuttled IPO before Beijing's regulatory crackdown in 2020.   The collective $850 billion wipe out in Alibaba and Ant's valuations has sent Ma's net worth plunging from about $61 billion in October 2020 to $34.1 billion as of Monday   On a personal level, Ma has also been lying low for more than two years.Ma angered Chinese authorities after giving a speech in October 2020 in which he criticized China's financial regulatory system and claimed Chinese banks were operating with a ""pawnshop"" mentality. His words prompted intense regulatory scrutiny of his businesses including Alibaba and Ant and a wider crackdown on tech firms in China.   In January, he was spotted in Bangkok, where he visited a Michelin-starred street-food restaurant and watched a Muay Thai fight. He also popped up in Hong Kong in the same month.   In March, Ma returned to a school he founded in his hometown of Hangzhou in eastern China.   In April, he was appointed an honorary professor at the University of Hong Kong. In May, Ma took up a teaching position in Japan, one of the first public roles he has assumed since disappearing from the spotlight in 2020.   Last month, Ma attended the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition finals in Hangzhou, where Alibaba is based.   Alibaba shares in Hong Kong were up 3% at 86.90 Hong Kong dollars apiece at midday, buoyed by news of the fine. The company's shares in New York closed 8.1% higher at $90.55 apiece on Friday."

I like the impulsive move from Mar. 2020 bottom towards Nov 2021 top, that had almost perfect match with the key Fibonacci retracements. Especially notice how  Nov top at 51.75 coincides with 1.00% ext of wave (1) projected from wave (4) and near first key resistance zone of 1.764% (of w.(1) from wave (2)).   Though the long lasting correction from Nov'21 highs doesn't look finished, due to advance from mid-term Jul'22 lows having yet only three waves, I still can entertain bullish (diagonal) set-up if price manages to hold 10W MA, consolidate around Sep'23 highs and break out above 50 resistance line (as per the green count).   I also like how price got volume support while touching the 10W during local correction from the Sep'23 highs, showing that there is potential interest from institutional money around that area.   Trading plan: I have entered initial long position, with todays break-out above the cheat pivot area of 44.75. I will be quick exiting with small single digits loss, if price will be able to follow through the following days.   Important notice: Elliot waves and fibonacci retracements are a very subjective form of analysis and I don't personally trade out of them. I use them only for the purpose of gauging structural potential of any assets, that allows me to put more confidence when low-risk trading set-up emerges. Author's personal multi-years trading experience convinced him that analysis and opinion doesn't pay, only price pays and that one shall not ever argue with price."

Fully bearish channels have been given and of course if the stock starts to plummet through multiple bearish channels, then best to ditch entirely.

The ETF has been trading below the orange and blue moving averages, confirming the downward momentum.   The dynamic trendline (blue diagonal line) has acted as a resistance, pushing prices lower whenever touched.   Support & Resistance Levels:   Bullish Line at 423.35 USD: This is a key support level. A sustained move above this, especially above the dynamic trendline, might indicate bullish momentum.   Target Price 1 at 424.64 USD: This acts as an immediate resistance. Once surpassed, we could see a move towards the next target.   Target Price 2 at 425.38 USD: Another key resistance level.   Target Price 3 at 426.92 USD: A significant resistance where some selling pressure might be encountered.   Target Price 4 at 428.67 USD: The ultimate target for bulls in the short term.   SPY at 420.45 USD: This is where SPY was trading when the chart was taken. If the futures have pushed the price to 422.5 USD, it suggests a bullish gap up at the open.   Volume:   The volume has been mixed, but there's a notable spike in the last candle. If this volume is related to buying activity and the price has gapped up to 422.5 USD, this can be seen as a strong bullish sign.   Implication of Gap Up:   If the market opens at 422.5 USD, it will be above the dynamic trendline, potentially indicating a bullish reversal or at least a temporary break in the bearish trend.   Such a break can act as a catalyst for further upward movement, especially if it's supported by high buying volume and positive market sentiment.   Ichimoku Cloud:   The ETF is trading below the cloud, which is a bearish sign. However, a move above the dynamic trendline and into the cloud can start changing this narrative.   To conclude, if SPY opens at 422.5 USD, it would suggest a positive start and potential bullish momentum for the session. However, it's essential to monitor how the ETF behaves near the mentioned resistance levels, especially around 423.35 USD and the subsequent target prices. External factors, news, and overall market sentiment will also play crucial roles in determining the direction. Always consider integrating other technical indicators and seek advice from financial professionals before making any investment decisions."

Trend & Moving Averages:   The stock has been on a downward trajectory recently, as evidenced by consistent lower highs and lower lows.   It has been trading below the orange and blue moving averages, reinforcing the bearish trend.   However, there is a sign of potential consolidation or reversal, as the stock price oscillates around the moving averages in the recent few candles.   Support & Resistance Levels:   Bullish Line at 41.91 USD: This seems to be a recent support level. The stock has bounced from this area a couple of times, suggesting its importance.   Target Price 1 at 42.29 USD: This is a minor resistance level. If the stock can break and hold above this, it might aim for higher levels.   Target Price 2 at 42.94 USD: A significant resistance level. If the stock can break through this, it might confirm a bullish reversal.   Target Price 3 at 43.43 USD: This is the next potential target if the stock can sustain its momentum after breaking through the previous resistance levels.   Volume:   There's a noticeable spike in volume on the last candle. The increasing volume might suggest heightened interest or activity in the stock, but it's crucial to determine the nature (buying/selling) of this volume in conjunction with price movement.   Ichimoku Cloud:   The stock is trading below the shaded cloud area, typically seen as a bearish sign. For a bullish confirmation, one would like to see the stock price break and maintain above the cloud.   Potential Reversal Indicators:   The stock's recent behavior around the moving averages and its approach to the resistance levels might suggest a potential change in momentum or a period of consolidation. This needs to be watched closely, especially in conjunction with volume and other technical indicators.   To conclude, while Halliburton Company has shown a bearish trend recently, there are signs of potential consolidation or a shift in momentum. It's essential to keep a close watch on how the stock behaves around the mentioned support and resistance levels."

Support & Resistance:   Bearish Line: The chart shows a bearish trendline that the price is attempting to break above.

Candlestick Patterns & Price Action:   The last few sessions demonstrate a mix of bullish and bearish candlesticks, suggesting volatility and indecision.   The latest candle (on 24th) is a small bullish candle. If it's followed by another strong bullish candle, it could signal a potential short-term reversal.   Volume:   Volume Profile: The volume appears to be relatively stable with some spikes. Notably, there is a significant volume spike on the last day. High volume accompanying a price movement can be a strong indicator of the strength of that movement.   The most recent bullish candle is accompanied by a notable increase in volume, which could indicate strong buying interest.   Notable Price Levels:   Bullish Line: The stock is trading close to this line. A break above this line could suggest a short-term bullish sentiment.   Bearish Line: If the stock moves downward and breaks this line, it could indicate further bearish sentiment.   Target Prices: These are potential price points where the trader expects the stock might move to. It's important to watch these levels as they can act as psychological levels of support or resistance.

It is with a heavy heart that I bring your attention to the recent revelation by Tesla Inc. (TSLA) regarding multiple subpoenas from the Department of Justice (DOJ). This development has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the company's future, leaving us with a sense of sadness and concern.   As traders, we have witnessed the rise and success of Tesla over the years, marveled at their groundbreaking innovations, and even celebrated their achievements. However, the recent disclosure of multiple DOJ subpoenas has raised serious questions about the company's practices and ethics. While we cannot jump to conclusions or pass judgment prematurely, it is essential to acknowledge the potential ramifications of such investigations.   In light of these developments, I feel compelled to share my concerns with you, my fellow traders. It is crucial for us to evaluate our positions and consider the potential risks associated with holding Tesla stock. While it is not my intention to dictate your investment decisions, I believe it is essential to be aware of the potential downside risks that may lie ahead.   Therefore, I encourage you to carefully assess your exposure to Tesla and consider the option of shorting TSLA. By taking a short position, you have the opportunity to profit from any downward movement in the stock price, should these investigations lead to unfavorable outcomes for the company. As traders, it is our responsibility to stay informed and make well-informed decisions to protect our portfolios.   Please understand that I do not take pleasure in sharing this information or promoting a bearish sentiment.

Support & Resistance:   Bearish Line: This line at approximately $124.97 is possibly acting as an immediate support. A breach below this line could see further declines.   Bullish Line: This line at approximately $125.90 might act as a resistance for the stock. A movement above this line could indicate bullish momentum.   Target Prices: Two target prices are highlighted at around $128.05 and $129.20, which might act as resistance points in case of an upward move.   Extended Support: There's another target price marked at $123.04 which could be a future support level if the stock continues its decline.   Moving Averages: The stock is trading below its moving averages, further indicating a bearish sentiment.   Volume: The volume bars seem to be increasing during down days, which can be a bearish sign. An increased volume on declining days can indicate strong selling interest.   Indicators:   Bollinger Bands: The stock price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which can sometimes indicate that the stock is oversold.   Average True Range (ATR): Without exact values, it's a bit tricky, but a rising ATR often indicates increased volatility.   Recent Price Action: The most recent candlestick appears to be a small bullish one, though it's contained within the range of the previous larger bearish candlestick. This could indicate a potential short-term reversal or consolidation, but it would be essential to watch further price action and other confirming indicators."

2023-10-23 15:33:06,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/MSTR/K6zse5SL-Microstrategy-could-benefit-from-the-rise-of-BTC/,"Good morning, Traders,   Today, we will analyse with   @mauricepriolo   the chart of MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), an American company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services. Founded in 1989 by Michael J. Saylor, Sanju Bansal, and Thomas Spahr, the firm develops software to analyse internal and external data to make business decisions and develop mobile apps.   After the big crash in 2022, a rebound phase from the lows began in January 2023 that led the stock first to test the 200-period Exponential Moving Average and then to the bullish crossing of the 50 Average on the 200 Average, giving an early hint of a trend reversal.   Since the cross, quote prices have steadily exceeded the EMA-200, using it as support in several situations.   In the last few months, we have observed an important lateralisation between the EMA-50 and the EMA-200 (SHIMANO); after several attempts to break the EMA-50, there has finally been a close above the resistance level in the last few sessions. In addition, the ANTICROSS signal reported by the indicator highlights the failure of further declines and confirms the validity of the given support of the EMA-200.   The levels to monitor for further bullish momentum are:   - Last week's high (white line) at 362.00 could be an important trigger point for an upward acceleration   - The first target zone (green rectangle) at 440.00, congestion area before the annual highs at 475.09   - The second target zone (red rectangle) is in the 500.00 area, the resistance zone that rejected the price in March 2022   Analysing the Intraday Timeframes, we find an upward crossing of the Slow Averages on the 1H chart, confirming a change of trend in the short term; we can await the Breakout movement by helping with the EMA-10 or using the EMA-50 as support, an eventual close below the EMA-200 could invalidate the bullish scenario of MSTR.   Taking a look at the data provided by Tradingview, the stock is aiming to hit its targets of returning to positive Earnings Per Share (EPS), from -129 in 2022 to an expected 30 in 2023, with the first half of the year seeing revenues in line with early year forecasts. Also, from the news provided by Trading View (source router), the stock is linked to Bitcoin's performance and could benefit from consolidating the 30,000 level by the cryptocurrency. The earnings release scheduled for November 1 is expected to give volatility to the stock, which has beaten market expectations so far.   In collaboration with   @mauricepriolo   Thanks for the support."

The rally was fueled by slower inflation and hype over artificial intelligence.   But more recently, the Federal Reserve's unwavering higher-for-longer rate stance and a deepening bond-market rout have had a sobering effect on equities sentiment, with the S&P 500 index halving its year-to-date gains.   Indeed stock valuations are looking increasingly stretched, raising the risk of a correction.   One such indicator in particular is flashing   RED   - the relative valuation of stocks versus the debt market.   SPX / ICE BofA Corporate Total Return Index   In August this year, the S&P 500   SPX   climbed to levels last seen during the peak of dot-com boom, relative to an index that tracks the US corporate bond market.   The gauge is still holding near those highs, despite the recent pullback in equities.   The metric last surged this high in the spring of 2000  and that was followed by a multi-year meltdown in stocks that saw the S&P 500 crash 50% between March 2000 and October 2002.   SPX 50% Decline During 2000-2002   Another indicator that shows the richness of stocks relative to debt is the so-called equity risk premium  or the extra return on shares over government debt, which is considered a safer form of investment. The metric has plunged this year lows unseen in decades, indicating elevated stock valuations.   ""Equity risk premium is near its worst ever level going back to 1927. In the 6 instances this has occurred, the markets saw a major correction & recession/depression - 1929, 1969, 99/00, 07, 18/19, present,"" research firm MacroEdge said in a   recent post on X   (ex-Twitter).   The so-called equity risk premium (earnings yield minus bond yield) recently fell to a new cycle low and remains well below historical averages. In other words, the stock market has become more expensive relative to the bond market despite the recent pullback.   Meanwhile the main graph (quarterly Div-adjusted chart for   TLT   20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) illustrates perhaps right there could the end for U.S. Govt Bond Market decline, with Double top as a further projected/ targeted upside price action.   Will all of that bring U.S. stock market to 50% decline like in early 2000s!?   Time will show!"

2023-10-23 14:45:33,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NVDA/xR4VCbzp-NVDA-Informative/,"NVDA   Main Observations:   Trend: The overall trend for the depicted timeframe is bearish. The stock has been creating lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative of a downtrend.   Moving Averages: The stock price is below all the given moving averages, including EMA(9), EMA(50), and EMA(200). This further confirms the bearish sentiment in the stock. The short-term moving average (EMA9) is also below the longer-term moving average (EMA50), suggesting that the current momentum is to the downside.   Support and Resistance:   Bullish Line: The immediate support is marked at approximately $418.75. This is labeled as the ""Bullish Line"".   Bearish Line: If the stock breaches this support, the next key level to watch would be around $408.08, which is the ""Bearish Line"".   There are also several target prices outlined, suggesting potential points of resistance. The immediate resistance seems to be around $424.80, with subsequent target prices at $431.54 and $439.38.   Volume: There's a noticeable spike in volume on the 16th, indicating increased trading activity on that day. High volume can be indicative of strong interest in a stock, but without the direction of the candle, it's hard to determine if it was buying or selling pressure.   Descending Trendline: The black descending trendline indicates that the stock has been respecting this line as a dynamic resistance. For any bullish reversal, it would be essential for the stock to break this trendline.   RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI is nearing the oversold territory (below 30). As of the last data point on the chart, the RSI is around 25. When the RSI is below 30, it suggests the stock may be oversold, which can sometimes be an indication that it may reverse or have a bounce soon. However, it's important to note that stocks can remain oversold for extended periods during strong downtrends.   Concluding Thoughts:   The chart indicates a bearish trend for NVIDIA in the given timeframe. For any significant bullish reversal, the stock would need to break above the descending trendline and move past the mentioned resistance levels. The nearing oversold condition in RSI might suggest a potential bounce or reversal, but it would be crucial to monitor other confirming signals. Always consider cross-referencing these observations with other indicators and factors before making any trading decisions."

2023-10-23 14:09:45,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AAPL/c0jmnIoN-AAPL-short/,"I think the AAPL ""Wonderlust"" show today was a disappointment to all who were hoping for an exciting new product to get announced. While the presenters did their best to hype all the ""firsts"" and ""bests"", it feels like nobody much cares anymore whether they have the latest and greatest phone. No matter what phone most of us have, it's probably capable enough, until the battery is too shot to make it through a workday. Once that point is reached, the question whether to replace the old phone with a new flagship phone, or with something at a modest price, will largely depend on the purchasing power of the consumer.   The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for August will be released next week, and I expect it to decline again, which would be the sixteenth consecutive drop. Consumer deposits are declining, and credit is harder to obtain (not to mention more expensive). The CB is clearly flagging a coming recession, as does the NY Fed's predictive model. If the US government shuts down in a couple of weeks, it will basically seal the deal. A recession and weakening consumer finances are rarely good news for makers of high-end consumer goods.   Meanwhile, Huawei just released their first new flagship phone in years. This phone is a real contender, especially in China, where it will play well not just because of its lower price vis--vis the iPhone, but also because of its ""developed in China"" pedigree.   AAPL has posted negative year-on-year sales growth for the last 3 quarters. Despite that fact it still sports a 30x forward earnings multiple, and the stock is up 35% YTD. I am short.   I expect the rising green trend channel to get challenged, and to break, and the declining (red) channel's bottom to get tagged.   I expressed this trade with a Nov 17 175/155 put spread, which cost me $4.70. I don't have any stop loss or target price at the moment. I expect that I might adjust this spread over time, and I might even close it temporarily, but I think there's a lot more downside to AAPL."

Expectations for inflation is as high as in Q4 2022 when inflation was very high in the US. I expect RINF to be lower by the end of the year than it is today. That is bullish for stocks.   If the interest rates go up further then this will finally harm employment levels and reduce profits which will lower US tax receipts. Based on that, the FED will need to hold interest rates or not raise them much more and this will be supportive in the short run for the market to go higher in the end of the year.   I expect the stock market is going to find a top around the end of the year or early 2024 and then, as unemployment rises, we are going to see short term interest rates come down and the market will likely have a capitulation event: perhaps Q2 2024. Given that the effects of positive real rates is hitting economies around the world it is likely that this is eventually going to hit the US economy as well. If people think this is a real possibility, then the incumbent President will prefer any inevitable crash happens early enough in 2024 that there can be an end of year rally for 2024 ahead of the Presidential election.   Obviously that isn't easy to control unless we put our tin foil hats on but there will be an earnest tug of war of ideas, of bulls and bears and of governors within the FED to put us in a better place for late 2024. Therefore, it would be good for the incumbent President if everyone can be reading headlines that say the 2024 recession is over. The other option will be to pivot a little early on FED funds rates and claim victory on inflation so that the stock market and economy gets a boost mid 2024 (with or without a capitulation event)."

Although I haven't been posting on it, I have still been tracking Rivian. We have been progressing nicely in our wave II retrace...almost too nicely.   We have completed our (A)-(B) waves and carved out what appears to be waves 1-4 of our C wave (working on the 4th or 5th now). What I expect to see next is a micro-5-wave count down to around the 1.382 fib line. We could extend out to the 1.618 though so be prepared for that. The secret is in the structure.   One thing I want to make you aware of is that we touched the 1.0 of the (A)-(B) wave and one could argue we have a completed structure for (C). If this is to be the case, we would want to see a HUGE jump up in a very bullish scenario to push us to high $30's - low $40's. The structure off of the $17.35 low doesn't seem bullish to me though.

2023-10-23 13:17:26,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/POR/WQDWC4Bu-Portland-General-Electric-POR-to-Report-a-Decline-in-Earnings/,"Portland General Electric (POR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.   The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.   While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.   This electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -30.8%.   Revenues are expected to be $770.34 million, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.   Estimate Revisions Trend   The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 43.48% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.   Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.   Earnings Whisper   Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the  Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.   The  Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.   Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.   A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.   Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).   How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Portland General Electric?   For Portland General Electric, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.   So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Portland General Electric will beat the consensus EPS estimate.   Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?   Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.   For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Portland General Electric would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of -6.38%.   Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.   Bottom Line   An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.   That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.   Portland General Electric doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."

It is a rare quality for a company to be able to re-invent itself (even more so several times) and be among next generation of multibaggers.   This analysis highlights several technical scenarios of price development, providing key short and mid-term areas of support and resistance that needs to be held and broken to shift odds into favour of a particular path. I don't personally plan to trade this stock until price will be able to consolidate, providing a low-risk entry point.   I can count 2023 move from Jan  into Jul as an initial wave (1) in a form of a three wave A-B-C diagonal. Since Jul, price is in its final wave of correction - C - with an ideal support area at 197-174-153 zone as the end of larger wave (2) correction, or only the first wave A as per alternative yellow count.   Having a closer look on wave C of (2): I cannot consider this correction to be over, until price is bellow 242 (the 0.618% c.i-c.ii). Until price stays bellow this area, I am expecting at least one more wave (c.v) deeper into ideal support zone. The move above 242, will force me to consider the correction of (2)/A to be over and re-analyse next resistance areas to the upside.   A few words on macro-degree structure. I consider a macro-upside potential to 700+, because the move from May 2019 lows, still looks unfinished as the five wave impulsive structure, having only 4 waves in place. The macro-move and wave structure looks quite orderly with price nicely following key resistance and support areas*.   If price moves bellow 153-128 support areas for wave (2), I will need to consider much bearish short and mid-term count being in place.   Important notice:   Elliot waves and fibonacci retracements are a very subjective form of analysis and I don't personally trade out of them. I use them only for the purpose of gauging structural potential of any assets, that allows me to put more confidence when low-risk trading set-up emerges. Author's personal multi-years trading experience convinced him that analysis and opinion doesn't pay, only price pays and that one shall not ever argue with price."

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.06%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.93%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.2%.   The gold and copper mining company's shares have seen a decrease of 5.41% over the last month, not keeping up with the Basic Materials sector's loss of 4.64% and the S&P 500's loss of 3%.   The upcoming earnings release of Barrick Gold will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Barrick Gold to post earnings of $0.23 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 76.92%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $3 billion, indicating a 18.67% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.   In terms of the entire fiscal year, Dexwirenews predict earnings of $0.87 per share and a revenue of $11.88 billion, indicating changes of +16% and +7.85%, respectively, from the former year.   Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Barrick Gold. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.   Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.   In terms of valuation, Barrick Gold is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.03. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 19.47.   It's also important to note that GOLD currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.46. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Mining - Gold was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.9 at yesterday's closing price.   The Mining - Gold industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 190, placing it within the bottom 25% of over 250 industries."

2023-10-23 06:00:50,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/CCCS/djnTLz6a-CCC-Intelligent-Solutions-Holding-Inc-Moon-or-Bust/,"Chart was brought up on my stream today, and I wanted to post a chart. Looks like a nice run-up stock looking for a decent crash that should equal some pretty large percentage losses. Short term parabolic stock, so when those green trends break, the pump is pretty much over, and you'll want to start looking for an exit or short position on the retouch, which looks like it might end up being 13.9, but it's too hard to say right now, as those trends are held up on weak support.   CCC Intelligent Solutions Holding Inc. exhibits promising signs in its current chart analysis. On the daily timeframe, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating a bullish sentiment, although we haven't detected strong trend momentum yet. However, what makes this chart intriguing is the presence of a potential 'cup and handle' pattern nested within a larger 'cup and handle' formation.   Digging deeper into the 4-hour chart, we find crucial trend support, which has not been breached, and the RSI has yet to cross into bearish territory. This solidifies the foundation for a robust short-to-medium-term outlook.   Furthermore, a notable price gap has been observed at $12.5, providing an interesting point of reference for potential price movement.   The 1-hour RSI suggests a short-term correction may be on the horizon, supported by a subtle emerging trend. This could strengthen our 4-hour trendline, potentially setting the stage for a surge towards the $14 mark, with an optimistic stretch target of $15.72 in the event of favorable developments.   It's essential to note, however, that the 5-minute and 15-minute charts are currently showing signs of being overextended, indicating a need for caution in the short term.   In terms of price targets, we have an upper range of $13.9 to $14.05, while the lower range stands at $8.47 to $7.41. While a maximum price of $18 to $20 is not entirely out of the realm of possibility, it's essential to maintain a realistic perspective, and such levels may not be easily attainable.   In the unlikely event of a significant downturn, the stock could potentially dip below $5. In such a scenario, it's crucial to be prepared for a potential bounce when the drop stabilizes.   Looking ahead to the start of the trading week, should Monday open with a downward movement, it could present a compelling buying opportunity around the $12.54 mark, aligning with the prevailing trend. Such a move would also serve to reset the technical indicators, potentially paving the way for a push towards $14 and beyond.   In conclusion, CCC Intelligent Solutions Holding Inc. holds promise in its chart patterns and technical indicators, making it an interesting stock to watch. As with any investment, prudent risk management is advised, but the potential for exciting price movements in the coming sessions is certainly worth keeping an eye on.   Personally, I don't know if I'll give this stock another look, but I'll try to keep the prices update on my site, should it really start to get away from this chart. But overall, be careful, sell fast, and possibly try to enter a short position, it's a pretty nice setup, with limited but very real risk.   Analysis does not take any fundamentals into account. I've never heard of this company before.   Nick   Yolo to the Moon"

I decided to look at the chart, and it looks like it's about to experience a break out pump, but I don't see the pump really being too significant overall. I'm not so sure it makes it past $15, but maybe.   HOWEVER, there are two things to note, one is the biggest green trend line. THAT IS STRONG. There is a high probability that buying off that big trend will result in a bounce and quick profit. How long it takes to get to that trend is the question. It could be awhile, but it doesn't have to be.   Here is the cool thing, because this stock looks to be maxing out, and seems to be nearing the top, it might be a good play short. Essentially, we pretty much know where it's going, we know it's breaking out on the short term, we're pretty confident there will be resistance at 14-15 with a max of 16-18, we can setup a trade play with this info as it gives us an above average chance of being profitable in multiple directions.   Example, you'll potentially see multiple bounces off the line with some well defined resistance, meaning you can trade both directions. Once that green trend breaks, as noted by the huge downward line, you'll likely see a BIG drop to the downside. When price touches the bottom side of that trend, there is a good probability the short position will be profitable."

The stock also broke below the 50-day moving average (blue line) on October 19, which acted as a support level in the previous uptrend. This was a bearish crossover that suggested a change in the trend direction. The 50-day moving average is now acting as a resistance level, as the stock failed to close above it on October 20 and 21.   The stock is currently trading near the 200-day moving average (red line), which is another important support level. If the stock breaks below this level, it could trigger more selling pressure and a further decline. The next support levels are at $250 and $200, which are the previous lows in June and February 2023.   The stock is also forming a bearish flag pattern (green lines), which is a continuation pattern that indicates a pause in the downtrend before another drop. The flagpole is formed by the sharp decline from $330.54 to $306.47, and the flag is formed by the consolidation between two parallel trend lines in an uptrend. A break of the lower trend line would signal the activation of the pattern and a target of $282.40, which is calculated by subtracting the length of the flagpole from the breakout point.   Therefore, based on these technical indicators, the outlook for META is bearish and the stock could face more downside risks in the near future. However, this analysis is not a recommendation to buy or sell any securities, and investors should do their own research and due diligence before making any trading decisions.

2023-10-23 01:20:06,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/IWM/rnqkUgru-Advanced-Bull-Flag-Concepts/,"Have you ever wondered why price action sometimes forms a bull flag pattern?   Have you ever wondered if there is a way to predict whether a bull flag will break out before it actually does so?   In this post, I will try to address these questions by presenting a couple of theories about the nature of bull flags.   Bull Flag Theories   (1) The flag structure of a bull flag tends to form along Fibonacci levels, with the ideal flag proportion being an approximated golden ratio to the flagpole; and   (2) Fibonacci and regression analyses can provide useful insight into whether price will successfully break out of its bull flag pattern, sometimes long before price even attempts to do so.   I will try my best to clearly explain both theories in detail below.   Note: Although this analysis is also generally true for bull pennants, bear flags, and bear pennants, to keep things simple I will focus solely on bull flags. Additionally, this analysis is generally true across timeframes.   Part I - The Basics of a Bull Flag   First, let's begin with the basics. As shown in the image below, bull flags form when an asset is in a strong uptrend. The uptrend forms the flagpole of the bull flag structure.   The flag structure forms when price consolidates, usually in a falling trend. This consolidation phase is often characterized by price oscillators rotating back down while the price retraces only a small part of its prior upward move.   From a market psychology perspective, bull flags often form when most market participants who bought the asset continue to hold it expecting the uptrend to resume, while only a minority of market participants sell (or short the asset) as its price corrects downward. The bull flag pattern is a   continuation pattern   because it reflects the market's general expectation that price will eventually resume its upward move.   Once the price definitively breaks above the upper channel of the flag (often with strong momentum and high volume), the bull flag pattern is validated. Upon breakout, the expected move up is equal to the vertical height of the flagpole.   Part II - The flag structure of a bull flag tends to form along Fibonacci levels, with the ideal flag proportion being an approximated golden ratio to the flagpole   Here's where things begin to get interesting. Below is the golden ratio.   Two quantities,   a   and   b   (where   a   >   b   ), form the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. (See the equation below)   The equation above shows the Greek letter   phi   which denotes the golden ratio.   Phi   is equivalent to a/b when such ratio is also equivalent to (a + b)/a.   Although bull flags can take various forms, it is my hypothesis, based on chart analysis and research, that the most perfectly structured bull flags (ones that also have the highest probability of successful breakouts) occur when the flag forms a golden ratio to the flagpole.   Mathematically, this means that the vertical height of the flagpole is equivalent to (a + b) and the vertical height (i.e. the width) of the flag is equivalent to b. This is also to say that price retraces down to the 0.382 Fibonacci level as measured by applying Fibonacci retracement levels along the flagpole (or to the 0.618 point on the vertical height of the flagpole if one measures from the bottom to top).   I realize that this can be quite confusing, so lets walk through some visualizations.   Let's first visualize this hypothesis using the golden rectangle. Below is an image of the golden rectangle. A golden rectangle is composed of a square (with sides equal to a) and a smaller golden rectangle (with width equal to b and length equal to a).   Now let's rotate the golden rectangle to better visualize the hypothesized flag pattern.   The bull flag is hypothetically an approximation of the golden rectangle, whereby the width of the flag is in a golden ratio approximation to the length of the flagpole.   In the illustration below, there are multiple bull flags contained within a Fibonacci spiral. The spiral is made up of golden rectangles, with each larger golden rectangle containing a smaller golden rectangle inside it. The smaller golden rectangle is the flag structure, and the length of the larger golden rectangle is the flagpole.   One can think of the Fibonacci spiral and the golden rectangles as a series of bull flags that build on top of each other in a repeating pattern. In this diagram, price is represented by the increasing length of the sides of each golden rectangle. In other words, the price on a chart can be seen as spiraling higher after each bull flag breakout.   Of course, not all bull flags form a structure that approximates the golden ratio, but it is my belief that in forming a bull flag, price action is aspiring to achieve as close of a golden ratio approximation as it can. I believe that the bull flags that best approximate the golden ratio structure also present the highest probability for a successful break out.   To learn more about Fibonacci spirals, including the golden spiral that Fibonacci spirals approximate, you can check out this Wikipedia article:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral   Part III - Fibonacci and regression analyses can provide useful insight into whether price will successfully break out of its bull flag pattern, sometimes long before price even attempts to do so.   To see how Fibonacci levels and regression analysis can give insight into whether a bull flag will break out or break down before it does so, let's consider an example.   Lets consider the massive bull flag that the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) formed in 2021.   In 2021, the monthly chart of IWM formed what appeared to be a bull flag, as shown below.   Now let's see why Fibonacci analysis and regression analysis were warning that this bull flag was   not   likely to break out successfully.   First, IWM's price did not retrace to a Fibonacci level before attempting a breakout (when using the pole as the Fibonacci retracement reference point). In the chart below, we see that price tried to break out, without even so much as retracing down to the highest Fibonacci retracement level: $196.71. By not undergoing Fibonacci retracement, price did not give its oscillators the opportunity to rotate back down fully. Instead, price remained overextended at the time it attempted to break out.   Now let's look at regression analysis. Below is a log-linear regression channel that contains IWM's entire price history. As noted in my prior posts, a regression channel simply indicates how far above or below the mean (or average) price an asset's current price is trading. In the regression channel above, the red line is the mean price, the upper channel line is 2 standard deviations above the mean, and the lower channel line is 2 standard deviations below the mean.   A successful breakout of the bull flag would have taken IWM's price way above its regression channel, to a level that is too many standard deviations above its mean price for us not to question the probability of the breakouts success. Achieving the full measured move up would have been extremely unlikely, assuming that the regression channel is valid and that price tends to revert back to its mean over time. What was more likely than a breakout was a breakdown, and a reversion back to the mean, which is what ended up happening with IWM.   Another interesting note about IWMs bull flag is that it presented a false breakout in November 2021. This false breakout was presenting multiple warnings signs including being a UTAD test of a Wyckoff Distribution. As shown below, however, another important clue that the November 2021 breakout would likely fail was that the breakout was not confirmed when comparing IWM to the money supply (M2SL). See the chart below.   One can interpret this chart to mean that in late 2021, IWMs price was rising because the central bank was increasing the money supply, but not due to improving strength of the underlying companies that comprise the ETF. Using the money supply as a ratio to an asset elucidates the true inherent strength of the asset's value. To understand more about why the money supply can be used in this manner, you can check out my post below.   Part IV - Additional Comments   I have a few additional comments. I usually use Fibonacci levels on a log-scale chart to identify Fibonacci spirals because Fibonacci spirals are logarithmic spirals. However, when using Fibonacci levels based on log scale, the ratios, percentages and numbers, can seem quite confusing because they are logarithmically adjusted. If you choose to replicate my process, please be mindful of this. While using log-scale charts is critical for higher timeframes (e.g. the monthly chart or higher), I have not identified much benefit to using it on shorter timeframes.   In a prior post, I noted that Plug Power (PLUG) is currently forming one of the best-looking log-scale, golden ratio bull flags I have ever seen. If my above hypotheses are true, I would expect to see PLUG move dramatically higher in the years to come. For more information about PLUG, you can read my post linked below. (This is not a solicitation to buy PLUG. Please do your own research and carefully consider all risks.)   At the risk of making this post too long and too dense, I just want to briefly note that it is also my hypothesis, based on observation and research, that the golden ratio is where many S-curve dilemmas are solved. If you don't know what an S-curve dilemma is and you'd like to read about this you can see my post below about   Jumping S-Curves   .   In short, an S-curve dilemma is another way of conceptualizing the question of whether a bull flag will break out or break down.   I hope that someone finds value in this post. I spent a lot of time studying, researching, analyzing, and cogitating the mathematical nature of price action to reach many of the conclusions here. Thank you for your valuable time in reading my post."

The company operates in the United States, Egypt, and the United Kingdom, with offshore exploration activities in Suriname. Established in 1954, APA Corp. is headquartered in Houston, Texas.   The primary rationale for recommending this stock lies in the current tense geopolitical situation, which has led to an increase in energy demand. As we approach the year-end, the energy sector is emerging as a clear choice for investors. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have directly contributed to a resurgence in oil prices. Additionally, gloomy macroeconomic prospects have intensified concerns about global demand. Furthermore, the United States has tightened sanctions on Russian crude oil exports (link), exacerbating the already strained market supply concerns. Global inventories are expected to decline in the fourth quarter, which is likely to drive energy prices even higher, benefiting a range of related companies.   From a financial perspective, APA Corp.'s Q2 2023 financial statements show an improvement in net income compared to Q1. The company's previous quarter's earnings were $0.85 per share, exceeding the estimated $0.75 per share, representing a 13.53% surprise. Although the estimated figure for Q3 is $1.74 billion USD, the company's revenue for the same period is $1.96 billion USD. The next quarter's estimated earnings are $1.19 per share, with anticipated revenue reaching $2.01 billion USD, indicating a stable financial performance. This stability aligns with the core investment philosophy of maintaining a steady course towards the end of the year, leveraging the trends resulting from the geopolitical landscape, much like the benefits accrued during the previous AI boom.   Furthermore, APA Corp. has been recognized by FORTUNE magazine as one of the Worlds Most Admired Companies for a fifth time, ranking fifth among international energy exploration companies, a testament to its operational excellence and reputation in the industry.   From a technical standpoint, APA Corp. is currently positioned at the breakout point of a descending wedge. On the daily chart, the RSI indicator has hit a bottom and is showing clear signs of a reversal pattern. In the MACD indicator, the $39 level marks a golden cross price point, while the Alligator indicator is beginning to contract upwards, signifying that the previous downtrend is nearing its end. The Fibonacci retracement at the 38.2% level offers significant support, and the stock is currently at the short-term resistance of 78.6%.

2023-10-22 20:42:17,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/LYV/ewDijCrk-Long-Term-Investment-Thesis-for-LYV/,"Looking for long term investments is always a challenge. Thing is you need to know what you are looking for. It makes a difference to find a company that is oversold and is sitting on the 200 moving average. I have an idea that we have a gap to close between the yellow lines. I think but, time will tell, that this stock possibly could break through to those yellow lines in order to fill the gap and fill the orders that are out there within that gap.   This stock is a company that has high director ownership at 32% which tells me they believe in their company. As I dive deeper, this company is constantly increasing their employees yearly to where they are now at 28,000 employees.   As far as the Market Value 18.40B and Enterprise Value 19.68B this company has two numbers that are close. However, they do have more debt than cash but it is close.   This stock is in the niche that has plenty of growth room and they are kicking it within the entertainment business and selling tickets online.   This is a company that is in the entertainment niche. They have cornered a market and many in the USA have used this company if they have attended college sports and events or any other venues that need and use a web based ticket collection agency. This company owns and operates TicketMaster which has taken the whole process of paper tickets to be replaced, bought, sold, exchanged via web based. This stock has been trading in the same range over the past 5 years for the most part. It has been going higher over time but, the markets have been off due to the corrections with in the market. This particular stock is set to go higher over time with many analysts putting $107 and higher price tags.   The insider ownership of the directors is nearly 32% ownership and their Market Cap is 18.40B whereas the Enterprise Value is 19.68 B, which are very closely aligned. The earnings per shares is $1.07. They have continuously been hiring new employees due to their growth over the years.   This stock is:   Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. operates as a live entertainment company.   LYV   It operates through Concerts, Ticketing, and Sponsorship & Advertising segments. The Concerts segment promotes live music events in its owned or operated venues, and in rented third-party venues; operates and manages music venues; produces music festivals; creates and streams associated content; and offers management and other services to artists.   The Ticketing segment manages the ticketing operations, including the provision of ticketing software and services to clients for tickets and event information through its primary websites livenation.com and ticketmaster.com, as well as through other websites, mobile apps, retail outlets, and call centers; and provides ticket resale services.   This segment sells tickets for its events and third-party clients in various live event categories; offers ticketing services for arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums, and theaters.   The Sponsorship & Advertising segment sells international, national, and local sponsorships and placement of advertising, including signage and promotional programs; rich media offering that comprise advertising related with live streaming and music-related content; and ads across its distribution network of venues, events, and websites.   This segment also manages the development of strategic sponsorship programs, as well as develops, books, and produces custom events or programs for specific brands.   It owns, operates, or leases entertainment venues in North America and internationally. The company was formerly known as Live Nation, Inc. and changed its name to Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. in January 2010.   Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in 2005 and is headquartered in Beverly Hills, California.   I personally buy stocks when I see setups in charting that I like which is just my style of investing. I have attached a detailed daily chart with RSI (37.44) that is showing this stock is oversold meaning that it is unloved at the moment but, most of the market is too but, it is not as cooled off as I would like to see it. Im personally looking for it to go closer to RSI of about 30. It is also beginning to reach a critical point of touching the 200 moving average line in which I will watch to see if it continues to hold there or proceeds to break through to the downside. If it continues to hold and stay within that price range for the next week. That indicates to me that a buying trend is beginning to form. The Volume and MACD is also showing a huge sell off so, I want to see that level off some as well. I do not plan to buy into this stock until I see the MACD cross upward and at minimum 5 days of similar stock price range with stronger buying volume than the current selling off volume. I personally am also looking at a gap that I know has orders still waiting to be filled where buyer and/or sellers are waiting to get this stock at $73.73 to $67.60 price range. Generally, not always, gaps have to be filled at some point in time. Im looking for the stock to drop into this range before I enter it. I might be late and disappointed if the markets take off and this one continues higher but, that is where Im looking to enter. I just wanted to share this company with the group because I see much here and personally have used this company to buy all my sporting event and concert event tickets over the past 5+ years.   I know we cant pin point the bottom but, I like to buy all the bottoms now that I understand how to read charts in order to have a better dollar cost average for long term stock investing. The reason I dollar cost average the bottoms, is because my personal psychology drives me crazy to see huge losses in my portfolio. Happy stock hunting and investing, yall!"

I recently published an idea predicting a fall in the share price to $215, which happened even faster than expected following the publication of more than disappointing results.   But now what?   Despite this bad news from a fundamental point of view, I remain in line with my initial analysis and believe that the correction is over.   We're coming up against a multitude of supports, namely the top of the ichimoku cloud, the 200-day, 50-week and 200-week moving averages, as well as the burgundy-red support line on the chart.   However, if we break this combination of supports, we'll probably go for the bottom of the ichimoku cloud, around $175. The death cross that has just appeared in the weekly also remains a danger.   In conclusion, although I'm expecting the price to bounce back, I currently prefer to stick to the expression ""never catch a falling knife"" and wait to see how the price moves at the start of the week before making my decision."

That means that even when the share price was higher than US$8.21 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.   Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.2m for 111.69k shares. But they sold 6.00k shares for US$71k. In total, Valley National Bancorp insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.   Insider Ownership   Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 1.4% of Valley National Bancorp shares, worth about US$59m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders."

That's better than the annualised return of 23% over halfa decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

2023-10-22 15:46:23,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/LMT/eurkVMZC-Has-LMT-Reached-The-End-War-Historic-Analysis/,"Disclaimer: I am in no way condoning violence, nor support either side of any conflict. This will be an analysis of   LMT   alone. With that being said let's dive in.   Introduction   We all heard the breaking news, as of October 7th, 2023 Israel and Palestine are officially at war with each other creating tension around the globe. Now I know you probably wondering, how it affects our economics on the Western front, specifically the stock market. What can we expect in the future, and of course can you turn a profit from all this? Toady, we'll dive deep into what stocks to pay attention to and how involved   LMT   ,   DFEN   , and   RTX   really are. So strap on your seat belts as we talk about the M word. No not morals, Money.   The Big Bois   Without a doubt the largest companies in the US for military exports are   LMT   ,   RTX   , and $NYSE:GD. The largest consumers of these military goods are Korea, Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and   Israel.   I will leave the   DFEN   ETF here which holds most of the companies I've mentioned and then some. We want to look at these companies when we hear conflict. With that being said let's head over to some charts.   *For a more in-depth analysis of military manufacturers, I suggest researching what companies are good for and what they supply, but at the end of the day, they all complement each other, which is why you really can't go wrong with $AMEX:DFEN. If it really matters it's just a Google search away.   1D   LMT   Percentage Increase Zones: I labeled these zones so we can get a clear view of the effects of war/conflict. This is the type of capitalization you can get from these scenarios, and we are seeing similar percentages to the ones from the Russian-Ukraine conflict. I believe the highest this can climb would be the all-time high, which just so happens to reach a perfect 29%, so something to be looking at.   Possible Rejection Levels: These are levels that can play as a resistance/retrace before a rejection to the downside.   Possible Support Levels: These are the levels that can play as a support/reversal to the upside.   Moving Average: 200 MA could play as a resistance and we could have reached the end of this first swing before we fell back down the the previous low.   MACD: MACD Showing signs of a bearish divergence perhaps, keep a sharp eye on that.   1W   LMT   Elliot Waves: I debated whether or not wanted to mark this as a complete Elliot Wave or not (12345) then (ABC). To each their own, this is expected when we talk about something as subjective as Elliot Waves.   FIB: The Fib is used to show possible retracement levels, which I labeled out in the ""possible rejection zone"" if this stock were to go lower.   Moving Average: 200 MA played as a perfect pillow, now we just see if it can stay that way.   Relative Strength Index: In each ""war"" zone I have shown the amount of buying pressure we usually see during these conflicts, but it seems we have no pressure, nor any indication that this will be bullish. In fact, we were oversold not too long ago.   Stoch RSI: Same with the Stock RSI we are in the (ABC) faze of the indicator.   Summary   Overall, we are seeing more   downward pressure   than any bullish indications, I believe we need to get through the bears first before this stock skyrockets. Another factor is that war must be prominent, something we really shouldn't be rooting for.   Bonus   RTX   and   DFEN   Please Please Please, like and follow the post if you found this helpful!

In today's economy when cost of car ownership, financing, insurance, etc the millennials are not buying cars, they are renting rides. Unfortunately there are limits to the renting of assets, one thing is commuting twice per week to the #coworking space. Another is renting the space or going on vacation to rent the #ABNB which has proven to be sometimes more expensive than a comparable hotel room across the US.

Higher interest rates and inflation have left consumers with less disposable income, as per the recent announcement from   @elon_musk   in relation to expansion of the manufacturing capacity in Mexico.   #ABNB has proven a broken model where hidden margins are expressed as cleaning fees. In real local fees these are price gauging and in many cases higher than the base for the asset use, the model is broken.   When compared to #NASDAQ100 or in the case #UBER which provides an alternative and preferred transportation model for the target demographic the superiority of the ride share model becomes clear.

The price almost touched Support 1 (410.00) on Friday and the Neckline (Higher Lows) of the pattern. As long as those hold, we can be bullish as the risk is low at the bottom while the upside much higher proportionally on Resistance 1 (476.50).   If however the price closes a 1D candle below Fib 1.0 (or even better Support 2), we will reverse to selling as the H&S suggests.

Meta Platforms (META -1.33%) has benefited from increased ad activity on its platform. The company has been delivering some improved growth numbers of late, and investors have become bullish on the tech stock this year. Shares of the company are up almost 160% year to date.   But before you think about jumping on this bandwagon, you should prepare yourself for some volatility in the future.   The metaverse will be a drag on earnings for years   The big problem with Meta always leads back to the metaverse and its Reality Labs business. It doesn't generate much money, and it may never be a significant part of the company's operations. So far this year, the company's Family of Apps segment, which includes popular social media apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has generated over $60 billion in revenue. Reality Labs, by comparison, has brought in $616 million.   That might seem reasonable for a new business, but consider that it has also incurred $7.7 billion of losses in the same period. Meanwhile, the Family of Apps business, which posted $24.4 billion in profit, has allowed Meta Platforms to remain in the black. But on a year-over-year basis, overall operating income of $16.6 billion is down 2%.   And this is with the company's core business doing well. Should its core operations struggle, the bottom line could seriously falter. And investors shouldn't forget the company continually warns that operating losses from Reality Labs will ""increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts.""   Meta Platforms could make for a volatile investment   If not for Reality Labs, Meta's business would be promising. But as long as that's going to be a key part of its growth strategy, investors should brace for volatility. Meta's growth rate jumped last quarter, but it still faces significant competition like TikTok. And if its Family of Apps business can't generate earnings growth at a faster rate than Reality Labs is incurring losses, the sell-off the stock saw in 2022 could return.   Meta is a risky stock to be holding with its valuation at these levels. and it will require the company's Family of Apps business to be firing on all cylinders for it to continue to draw in growth investors. A big test will come later this month when the company reports its latest round of earnings"

I believe that Tesla shares are in a long-term uptrend that will last until the end of this decade. If we now look at the prospect for the next 1-2 years, then I believe that a double zigzag of WXY is being formed and the price is likely to update the critical loy of January 2023 in the region of 100$ dollars.   In this case, the bottom of the bear market will be at 70$ per share, and this goal will most likely be achieved from October 2024 to May 2025. After that, I expect to see a reversal and a long-term bull market. It should be just an incredible bull market in the primary wave of the third cycle, the best time to invest and trade according to the trend.   The price will break through ATH 414.50$ and will continue to grow steadily to new incredible price highs.    If the 299.29$ disability level is exceeded much earlier and the goal of reducing 70$ is not achieved, then this trading idea will need an update. It will be necessary to roll back in order to find an error and make a correction to the real movement marks on the price chart.    Everything is on the chart  - Good luck in making independent trading decisions and profit!   Goodbye!"

2023-10-22 10:45:21,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NFLX/NyC8MT8X-Earnings-Glory-and-Quiet-Storms-Netflix-s-Path-Forward/,"Netflix has experienced a remarkable surge in subscriber growth attributed to its proactive measures to curtail password sharing and the introduction of a new ad-supported subscription tier. In the third quarter, the global streaming juggernaut welcomed an impressive 8.76 million new subscribers, significantly outpacing Wall Street's conservative estimate of 5.49 million. This milestone represents the most substantial quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2020, a period marked by a surge in subscriptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   In terms of financial performance, the results for this quarter are as follows:   1- Earnings: Netflix achieved earnings of $3.73 per share, surpassing the projected figure of $3.49 per share (as per LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv).   2- Revenue: The company generated revenue of $8.54 billion, aligning precisely with the expected figure of $8.54 billion (according to LSEG).   3- Total memberships: Netflix reported a total of 247.15 million memberships, exceeding the anticipated 243.88 million (according to Street Account).   Nonetheless, it is important to consider that there are underlying aspects that may not be immediately apparent to investors, but could impact the company's stock price in the future.   Firstly, Netflix's trailing twelve-month Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 38.19, which exceeds the historical average of approximately 15. This valuation places Netflix in the category of overvalued stocks, as investors are paying a premium compared to its earnings. Netflix's trailing twelve-month earnings per share (EPS) of 9.39 may not fully justify its current market valuation. It is important to note that trailing P/E ratios may not account for a company's projected growth rate, which can lead to elevated P/E ratios driven by expectations of substantial future growth, even if current earnings appear low.   Further, Netflix boasts a 12-month forward Price to Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio of 1.36. This suggests that the market is currently valuing Netflix above its expected growth potential, given that a PEG ratio above the fair market value of 1 indicates overvaluation. The PEG ratio of 9.39 is calculated by dividing its forward price to earnings ratio by its growth rate. PEG ratios are a widely used valuation metric, as they consider various fundamental metrics and prioritize the firm's future rather than its past performance. The combination of these valuation metrics paints a somewhat unfavorable picture for Netflix at its current market price, due to an overvalued PEG ratio despite robust growth.   Furthermore, Netflix recently implemented price hikes for its services, with the basic subscription rate in the UK rising by 1 to 7.99 and the premium option increasing by 2 to 17.99. Similarly, premium plans in the US and France experienced price increases of $3 and 2, respectively. While these adjustments are indicative of the company's growing confidence, they come at a time when Netflix is confronting concerns about its ability to continually attract new members amidst mounting competition, escalating prices, and disruptions caused by a Hollywood strike.   It is worth noting that in a landscape of intensifying competition and Netflix's imposition of increased constraints on its subscribers, such as price hikes and sharing limitations, there is the potential for adverse implications on future subscriber growth.   From a technical standpoint, Netflix's price chart illustrates the completion of five upward waves within an ascending channel, with a subsequent breakage and retesting of the channel. This retest has generated a considerable price gap that suggests a likelihood of retracement to fill the gap. Should this scenario unfold as anticipated, there is a possibility that prices may revert to prior lows, particularly around the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level at approximately $286.00. A breach of this level could precipitate a further decline, potentially revisiting the initial channel starting point at $170.00.   I encourage you to delve into my other analyses, as they provide valuable insights into the broader economic landscape. By combining these analyses, you'll gain a clearer understanding of what's on the horizon.   Your commitment to assessing multiple viewpoints is a commendable approach to informed decision-making in the complex world of financial markets.   Goodluck!"

In fact, in the   last 10 years   it is developing an   ascending wedge   .

It is likely that these next two weeks, the downward correction will persist until   November 2 when the company publishes results   . We would be talking about an environment around   $159   . There is a   great support   there:   -   EMA 100 sessions   -   floor of the long term ascending wedge   - proximity of a   strong liquidity zone   At this level ($159) the   rebound or its perforation will be of great violence   and with great volume, all conditioned by the company's business results:   - if they were   read positively by the market   :   AAPL   would rebound with great force (closing of shorts + strong oversold). We would see again   historical highs   with a   target in the upper zone of the rising wedge   (around   $270-300   ).   - If these were   read negatively by the market   : this relevant support would be lost and the   AAPL   would send us a great medium-term bearish signal with a target at the floor of the 2005 bullish channel   (around   $130   ). If a   downward opening gap   appears, leaving the support of the rising wedge ($159) above, it would give us a great bearish trading window.   Stop loss   : above the gap.   Target   : floor of the long-term channel ($130).   1 D   If we extend the chart to a 1-day period, we will observe that   the current short-term bearish movement   has its   origin in a gap that did not close on August 4th   . The   TSI indicator   at the present time has given a bearish signal, so it is   highly probable that the falls will continue in the next few days   .   We must remember that there is a   large liquidity zone around $150-155   that could greatly accelerate the rises or falls.

Monday is going to be a big deciding factor for the rest of the week. If we break the support zone then I see this thing dropping hard. If by the grace of God we can stay in that Green Zone on Monday then there's a chance for a bounce. Another thing that stands out is the MACD starting to transition from red to green here on the daily which is no bueno for bulls.   -AAPL-  We're sitting right at the 200 EMA and there's a chance we can get support here. Also we're sitting at a crucial trendline which dates bake to March 2023. If we break that trendline though then its GG.   -AMZN- In the last 3 weeks AMZN has found support here at 125ish. This will be the 3rd touch of this trendline. It's imperative that we keep an eye out for a clean break below 125 this week.   -NVDA- There's a very clear head and shoulder here that look like its done forming and ready to drop. If it does drop as I think we can fill this gap at $318.28 within the next 2 weeks.   Don't be too quick to jump in these trades because you can get faked out around these crucial levels. If you want to trade with me, per usual I will post my trades after the first hour of Market open if there are nice set ups. If I dont see an clear set up then I won't trade. If you would like to add some Input feel free up. Lastly Always do your own DD before trading, this here is only my perspective. Good Luck this week "

Companies such as UiPath, Intuitive Surgical, and Palantir Technologies have seen significant growth in recent years, but it is important to consider their market capitalization and share prices before investing.   UiPath, a software automation company, went public in April 2021 with an initial market capitalization of around $36 billion.   Intuitive Surgical, a company that produces surgical robots, has a market capitalization of over $93 billion.   Palantir Technologies, a data analytics company, went public in September 2020 with an initial market capitalization of around $22 billion.   It is also important to consider the rating of the shares and the security of the company before investing. For example, UiPath was rated as a buy by several analysts following its IPO, but investors should also consider the potential risks and competition in the market.   In terms of upcoming IPOs, there are several AI companies that are expected to go public in the near future, including UiPath's competitor Automation Anywhere, online education platform Coursera, Googles company Waymo, and others.   As with any investment, it is important to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any decisions. While the investment potential of these companies is undoubtedly significant, investors should be aware of the risks involved in investing in new and untested technologies. AI companies are subject to a variety of risks, including regulatory risk, intellectual property risk, and competition from other companies in the sector. As such, investors should carefully consider their investment options and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.   In terms of investment potential, it's important to note that investing in AI Companies can be risky, as with any new technology. However, for those willing to take the risk, the potential rewards could be substantial. The key is to do your research and choose companies that have a solid business plan and a proven track record of success. It's also important to keep an eye on the broader market trends and economic indicators, as these can have a significant impact on the success of any investment.   When it comes to security, AI technology is still in its early stages and there are certainly risks involved. However, companies that are dedicated to building secure AI systems and investing in the necessary security measures should be able to mitigate these risks to some extent. It's also important to note that as AI technology continues to evolve, so too will the security measures that are needed to protect it.   As AI technology becomes more advanced and more widely adopted, there will be a growing demand for companies that can provide innovative solutions in this space. This presents a significant opportunity for investors who are willing to take a long-term view and invest in companies that are dedicated to the ongoing development of AI technology.   -----------------------------------------------   Risk Warning   Trading stocks and options is a risky activity and can result in losses.

2023-10-22 06:58:08,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/MOS/maHXZABg-Stocks-pairs-trading-AGCO-vs-MOS/,"In the agriculture sector, AGCO Corporation (AGCO) and The Mosaic Company (MOS) are two significant players with differing growth prospects and performance metrics. Both have their unique merits and challenges, which offer an intriguing opportunity for a pairs trading strategy. The goal here is to capitalize on their differences and aim for a reversion to their historical performance relationship. Specifically, the strategy contemplates going long on AGCO and short on MOS.   Why Go Long on AGCO:   Valuation:   AGCO has a P/E ratio of 7.63, which is higher than MOS's P/E of 5.59. However, AGCO's forward P/E remains the same at 7.63, offering stable prospects compared to MOS's forward P/E of 10.25, which signals a potential overvaluation.   Profitability:   AGCO has an impressive ROA of 10.45% and a strong ROE of 29.56%. In contrast, MOS's ROA and ROE stand at 9.20% and 17.96%, respectively. AGCO also boasts an EPS this year of 23.36%, which is promising for future profitability.   Performance Metrics:   Although AGCO has seen declines recently, it has a positive Perf Year of 5.95%, making it a candidate for a rebound.   Why Short Mosaic Company (MOS):   Valuation:   Despite its low P/E of 5.59, MOS's forward P/E rises to 10.25. Coupled with declining performance metrics, this could indicate a potential overvaluation.   Short Interest:   MOS has a short float of 1.11%, which is low but not negligible, hinting at some level of negative sentiment that could substantiate a short position.   Profitability:   MOS's ROA of 9.20% and ROE of 17.96% are both lower than AGCO's. MOS also has a negative EPS this year of -63.84%, making it less appealing for a long position.   Performance Metrics:   MOS has experienced declines across the board in Perf Week, Perf Month, and Perf Quarter, reinforcing the short decision.   Decision:   Long on 1 AGCO   Short on 3 MOS"

VOLATILTIY.   I use the VXX ETN for the metrics it provides, albeit its idiosyncrasies.   August into September, a breakdown into a lower range indicated that a RISK-ON situation was in the equity markets. Since September, this started reversing, rather strongly, and consolidated at the earlier range.   In the past week, Thursday, it gave an real indication of what is forming... a significant Volatility breakout. This first stage break out is seen with the breaking out of a trend line, formed by the 4/1 line of the Gann Fan. This movement is a rather solid candlestick with momentum to boot, and both MACD and VolDiv are crossing up bullishly and breaking into the next upper range.   So, expect a break out of the upper range (orange rectangle), as well as the 8/1 line of the Gann Fan forming the next trend line resistance. When this happens, VXX may be spring boarding to 35, from 26-27 area. That is like a 50% increase in VXX.   Keep a close eye on this... the more the signs point, the more real it becomes."

A significant increase in trading volume further exemplifies this rally.   As uranium spot prices continue to show potential for further gains, the question arises: can   CCJ   sustain its upward momentum? Several indicators suggest a positive outlook.   1. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has recently formed a bullish crossover, signalling strong momentum in favour of the bulls.   2. Additionally, the stock is currently positioned at the 50-day moving average.   3. Furthermore,   CCJ   has successfully tested the $36 resistance level, which has now turned into support, making for a robust double-bottom pattern.   All of these technical signals point to a favourable long position. Investors speculating on   CCJ   at this juncture may stand to gain healthy profits if the current trends persist."

2023-10-21 20:14:23,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BKR/K4w2OqxB-BKR-Energy-stock-has-room-to-out-perform/,"Oil related equities demonstrate impressive relative strength to the rest of the sectors, occupying 6 out of 10 best performing market groups.   HAL - is one of the best stocks in the energy sector, with impressive consecutive earnings and sales growth 4 qrts in a row and double digits growth in eps estimates.   Beside strong fundamentals, I always look for the price to establish reliable basing pattern with low risk entry point. Preferably I want this pattern to fit well into the larger elliott wave context, having upside potential within the price structure.   Within the structure from 2020 lows, I can see at least one more move to the upside into 40-45-47 area of larger resistance.   Trading plan:   if price manages to break out above Friday's highs with volume rising above average, I will be planning to start building the position with 3-5% stop. Further follow-through above 36.2 and later 36.9 area would be a signal to add-on to position.   Other technical signs to consider:   - I was wowed by five (!) consecutive tight weekly closes. History of true market leaders (TML) through out each and every up-cycle teaches us that every TML had 2-3 weeks of tight closes during initial phases of price advance.   - Though afterward breaking out from 5 weeks tight base, price faced 5 weeks of decline below this base, with some signs of distribution. Probable that was due to general market sell-off, but price is still below key 10w. MA, meaning it is still vulnerable to the downside;   - I like the break-away gap in the beginning of October - sign of strength.   The short-term potential of the analysis is valid until price stays above Oct. lows.   Caution: Earnings are scheduled next week.   Important notice: Elliot waves and fibonacci retracements are a very subjective form of analysis and I don't personally trade out of them. I use them only for the purpose of gauging structural potential of any assets, that allows me to put more confidence when low-risk trading set-up emerges.

2023-10-21 20:08:45,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/WERN/TlgwPrMN-NASDAQ-WERN-Boasts-Of-Strong-Institutional-Backing/,"With 87% ownership, Werner Enterprises, Inc. boasts of strong institutional backing.   Key Insights   1. Institutions' substantial holdings in Werner Enterprises implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price   2. A total of 9 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership   3. Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company   To get a sense of who is truly in control of Werner Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:WERN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).   Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.   What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Werner Enterprises?   Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.   As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Werner Enterprises. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth.   Insider Ownership Of Werner Enterprises   The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.   Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.   Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Werner Enterprises, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$31m. Most would see this as a real positive. It is good to see this level of investment by insiders."

This seems so because the earlier wave resembled a bearish Corrective Wave (red coloured wave). Also notice that during this bearish Corrective Wave, AAPL formed an AB = CD pattern.   After the first impulsive wave of the bullish Motive Wave, the second wave ie. the corrective wave 2 made a 38.2 percent retracement.   The fourth wave ie. the corrective wave 4 of the bullish Motive Wave has made a 50 percent retracement. Usually the fourth wave retraces between 23.6 to 38.2 percent retracement. However, since the overall market is weak, I think the retracement went down to 50 percent level.   In the fourth corrective wave 4, a triangle formation is in progress (yellow coloured). This looks like a barrier triangle since legs 1 and 3 are at the same level. Each of the three legs has three sub-waves.   AAPL should start moving up from today towards the upper trend line of the triangle, making fourth leg of the barrier triangle. Then, descend a little to make the 5th leg, thus completing the barrier triangle formation (3-3-3-3-3) and also fourth corrective wave 4.   After completion of fourth corrective wave 4, impulsive wave 5 should begin. Usually impulsive wave 5 is between inverse 1.00 to 1.618 of corrective wave 4. Impulse wave 5 would have reached 215 in a strong market. However, since the overall market is weak, AAPL will be able to move just above 200.   Thereafter, we can expect a deep correction."

Investors are digesting how the Federal Reserves higher for longer interest rate policy will impact the economy, and theyre not pleased with the prospect. Other challenges on the horizon include the ongoing Congressional budget battles, lingering inflation, the evaporation of consumer savings and purchasing power, and concerns over Chinas incendiary combination of slowing growth, geopolitical ambition, and approaching demographic collapse.   Thats a lot to digest, but covering the situation from banking giant J.P. Morgan, global investment strategist Madison Faller believes there is some reason for optimism through the autumn.   When it comes to stocks, the recent selloff means valuations are more reasonable today than they were before Focusing on valuations alone also ignores the actual experience of companies. The S&P 500 has already suffered through three quarters of earnings declines, and expectations for future earnings have been rising steadily over the last six months. Despite all the worry, that backdrop could spur stocks to new highs over the next year Staying invested through the uncertainty has typically served investors best, Faller opined.   So, given this optimistic perspective, the question is, which equities should investors consider adding to their portfolios? J.P. Morgan analysts have pinpointed two names they believe would be valuable additions.   And they are not alone; according to TipRanks database, both stocks are also rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Lets see why they are drawing plaudits across the board.   Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD)   Well start in the biotech sector, where Amicus is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the treatment of rare diseases. These are typically disease conditions with small patient bases and devastating effects. Amicus is working on new therapeutic agents with novel actions to deliver advanced treatments with a patient-centered focus.   This company has achieved its goal and reached the brass ring  it now has two approved drugs on the market. The first of these, Galafold, is a treatment for adults suffering from Fabry disease; the second is a combination therapy, Pombiliti and Opfolda, used in the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease.   These approved drugs have given Amicus a steady revenue stream. The company reported $94.5 million in global revenue for 2Q23, the last quarter reported, beating the forecast by ~$4.6 million. The revenue was also up 17% year-over-year.   Looking ahead, Amicus is predicting that sales of Galafold will show revenue growth in the 14% to 18% range for the full year 2023. The company credits this outlook to high demand and commercial expansion in the US, UK, EU, and Japanese markets. Also of note, Amicus has received regulatory approval from the EU in Q2 for the commercial launch of the Pombility+Opfolda combination therapy.   JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama is impressed by the full commercialization potential of Amicus, writing of the company, With peak sales of ~$600M+ for Galafold and ~$750M+ for Pombiliti + Opfolda, we believe that FOLD shares are undervalued. As Pombiliti + Opfolda was approved in Pompe disease in 3Q23, we believe that the therapy shows best-in-class potential and it has been noted that the therapy is preferred by KOLs we have spoken with   Net-net, at current valuation levels, we continue to think that solid execution on the Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda should drive value into the mid- to high-teens / share level, Rama summed up.   Looking ahead, Rama rates FOLD an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sees it hitting a share price of $19 for ~71% one-year upside potential.

2023-10-21 16:33:18,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/k39bp7ol-Option-strategies-for-TSLA-earnings/,"Tesla will post its financial results for the third quarter of 2023 after market close on Wednesday, October 18, 2023.   TSLA: Oct 2nd,2023   In the third quarter, we produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered over 435,000 vehicles. A sequential decline in volumes was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades, as discussed on the most recent earnings call. Our 2023 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.   Fundamental Analysis: (Negative)   Lower numbers for produced cars, Lower operational margins, and Lower sales are not what the market rewarded!   Technical Analysis: In the consolidation zone below the resistance line!   Important Resistance levels: 278-300   Important Support levels:234-212   Expected volatility: 13-20%   Direction of breakout? No one can predict that!   So what should we do?   For Stock traders, it is not recommended to open a position!   For option traders, the story is different:   we have two different options!   Long Straddle 265 for October 20 at 20-21 USD/contract   or   Long Strangle Oct 20,2023 call 285 with Put 235 at 6USD/contract   Option Profile:   option wall: 200-300   Max Pain: 255   Put/call: 0.975   Note: If TSLA doesn't make a sharp move in the next 8 days both strategies lead to loss!   Education:   A long strangle is an options strategy that involves buying a call option and a put option with different strike prices and the same expiration date. The call option has a strike price that is above the current market price, while the put option has a strike price that is below the current market price.   A long straddle is similar to a long strangle, but the strike prices of the call and put options are the same.   Both long strangles and long straddles are bullish strategies that profit if the underlying asset price moves significantly in either direction. However, they differ in terms of their risk and reward profiles.   A long strangle has a lower risk than a long straddle because the strike prices of the call and put options are different. This means that the trader will only lose money if the underlying asset price does not move significantly in either direction.   A long straddle has a higher risk than a long strangle because the strike prices of the call and put options are the same. This means that the trader will lose money if the underlying asset price does not move significantly in either direction.   However, a long straddle also has a higher potential reward than a long strangle because the trader can profit if the underlying asset price moves significantly in either direction.   Which strategy is better for you depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. If you are looking for a lower-risk strategy with a lower potential reward, then a long strangle may be a good option for you. If you are looking for a higher-risk strategy with a higher potential reward, then a long straddle may be a better option for you.   It is important to note that both long strangles and long straddles are complex strategies and should only be used by experienced traders."

The Sao Paulo-based neobank has over 85 million customers across Latin America, with a strong financial outlook bolstered by significant investments, including from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. However, the company faces challenges like market volatility, regulatory risks, and high loan loss provisions. The report's final recommendation is a ""Buy"" for Nubank's stock, considering its growth potential and current market positioning.   Key Points:   Market Overview   The global neobanking market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 54.8% from 2023 to 2030.   Nubank's Position   More than doubled its customer base in two years, currently the fourth-largest financial institution in Brazil in terms of customer numbers.   Regulatory Environment   Brazil is modernizing its financial system, providing a favorable environment for fintechs like Nubank.   Consumer Behavior   High adoption rates for neobanks globally, especially in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.   Competitive Dynamics   Neobanks could act as aggregators, integrating various financial services, challenging traditional financial systems.   Financial Performance   Nubank's revenues and assets have shown robust growth, despite periods of losses. Key investments, especially from Berkshire Hathaway, have bolstered its financial stability.   Risks and Challenges   Market volatility, regulatory environment in new markets, and Warren Buffett's skepticism towards cryptocurrencies are some of the risk factors.   Technical Analysis   Bullish signs, but caution is advised as the stock is approaching overbought territory.   Conclusion   Nubank appears well-positioned for growth in the burgeoning neobanking sector but comes with inherent risks related to market volatility and expansion into new territories."

At this point in time, it has pushed slightly below the 0.382/0.886 Confluence Zone and is now at the 200 SMA, but with that, we can see that the Local Bullish Shark can extend into a 1.618 Extension, so the Breakout watch is far from over on GME though we are getting towards levels where one may leave it alone.  I would say that if GME breaks below $11.50, there would be a very distinct chance of it dumping down to $9.5, but if it instead holds above $11.5 and pushes back above $14.00, then we could instead see GME make a rapid move up to $18.00, which would be just high enough to test the supply line of our Channel/Falling Wedge. From there we could possibly break out of it and go for the measured move, but for now, I'd say one would probably want to have a short-term position to take profits on at $18.00 and a separate longer-term position to hold strong until GME gets the big measured move breakout to $74 - $134"

We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention.   Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.   Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?   We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a companys earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that dont share these attributes.   Masimo's Earnings Growth And 8.9% ROE   At first glance, Masimo's ROE doesn't look very promising. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.1%. Having said that, Masimo's net income growth over the past five years is more or less flat. Remember, the company's ROE is not particularly great to begin with. Hence, this provides some context to the flat earnings growth seen by the company.   Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 8.1% over the last few years.   Is Masimo Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?   Masimo doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. However, this doesn't explain why the company hasn't seen any growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.   Summary   In total, am ambivalent about Masimo's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future"

2023-10-21 12:15:23,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/KNX/QVHCKo5Z-Why-Knight-Swift-Transportation-Stock-Popped-Today/,"KEY POINTS   a. Profits fell sharply but still beat estimates.   b. Knight-Swift seems likely to benefit from Convoy's bankruptcy.   c. The company is making profits with its integration of U.S. Xpress.   The diversified trucking company topped estimates and appears to be turning the corner in its U.S. Xpress acquisition.   Shares of Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX 11.75%) were moving higher today after the diversified transportation company topped analyst estimates in its third-quarter earnings report.   The competitive landscape is improving for Knight-Swift   Knight-Swift, which offers full-truckload, less-than-truckload (LTL), logistics, and intermodal services, posted solid revenue growth in its third quarter with the top line up 6.5% to $2.02 billion, ahead of estimates at $1.89 billion, helped in part by its acquisition of U.S. Xpress.   That growth was driven by its full truckload business, which saw revenue jump 22% to $1.17 billion, excluding its fuel surcharge.   However, profitability in that key segment fell due to an ""extremely difficult environment,"" including ongoing soft demand, and an increase in fuel prices. Adjusted operating ratio, which is the inverse of operating margin and excludes the U.S. Xpress acquisition, jumped from 81.8% a year ago to 94.9% but improved slightly from the second quarter.   Profit margins also shrank in the logistics and intermodal segments, and overall adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell from $1.27 to $0.41, ahead of the consensus at $0.36.   Comments on the earnings call seemed to give the stock a boost. As CEO Dave Jackson said, ""It feels like the extreme aggressiveness that we have seen out of non-asset-based players has reached a level to where it's not only unsustainable but when you add how expensive financing is ... it blows up."" Those remarks seemed to refer in part to the closure this week of digital freight broker Convoy.   Can Knight-Swift stock move higher?   Knight-Swift revised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.10-$2.30 to $2.10-$2.20, and management forecast that truckload rates would stabilize at current levels and says it expects solid growth in LTL revenue and shipments.   It also sees the bottom-line impact from the U.S. Xpress acquisition improving, a sign that the company will return to profit growth in 2024."
2023-10-21 12:06:27,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/GBTC/UGsZxhCj-What-s-going-on-with-Grayscale-The-good-and-the-bad/,"The text below is something I wrote about a month ago, deleted from Twitter, then turned into a Twitter Thread, but I had forgotten to share it here on Tradingview. I am putting this out as a basis for my next idea about Bitcoin and Crypto, as it's important to understand the situation of Grayscale fully.   The Good   The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), managed by Grayscale Investments, is one of the primary vehicles for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated environment. However, it's structured as a trust, not an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has led to some notable price discrepancies between the value of the Bitcoin held by the faith and the market price of GBTC shares.   Grayscale has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin ""spot"" ETF, which would track the price of Bitcoin directly. However, the SEC has denied these attempts, approving ETFs that follow Bitcoin futures contracts instead, citing fraud and investor protection concerns.   Grayscale has taken legal action against the SEC, arguing that the regulator has been ""arbitrary and capricious"" in its treatment of Bitcoin-related financial products. It's a significant move that could have broad implications for the future of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.   The likelihood of GBTC converting into an ETF largely depends on how the lawsuit unfolds. The case centers on the argument that the SEC has treated similar applications inconsistently, approving futures-based Bitcoin ETFs while rejecting spot-based ones, despite both types of products being susceptible to potential manipulation and fraud.   Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein has expressed optimism about the case, stating that he expects a decision by the end of Q3 2023. Some Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate that Grayscale has a 40% chance of winning the lawsuit. Despite this, the outcome is still uncertain.   If Grayscale wins the case, the implications would be significant. GBTC becoming an ETF would be a milestone for the cryptocurrency industry, potentially drawing more mainstream investors into the Bitcoin market. However, it could also lead the SEC to reconsider its previous approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs.   Should Grayscale lose, they have indicated that they would consider appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would prolong the process. Regardless of the outcome, industry observers will closely watch this case, as it could set a precedent for future Bitcoin ETF approvals in the U.S.   Keep in mind even if Grayscale's lawsuit is successful, it would not guarantee immediate approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC could still impose certain conditions or requirements to address its concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. The approval process for such a product would likely involve extensive discussions and negotiations between Grayscale and the SEC.   The bad.   Grayscale made a series of mistakes, some of which could be criminal, and they weren't simply 'mistakes' or 'accidents. As explained by David Bailey in this interview (I urge everyone reading this to listen to it)   youtube.com/watch?v=KZPE_xro...   , Grayscale, and DCG attracted lots of investors in the Trust, and although they could help them and let them go, they aren't doing it. To me, it seems like Barry and his gang did actually commit crimes, and they could eventually have to pay for it. As the bad is really bad, especially with the discount of the Trust being so high, shareholders are trying different things to close the discount and get their money back.   The Voice of Activist Shareholders   Activist shareholders, a group comprising hedge funds, asset managers, and retail investors, have not hesitated to voice their dissatisfaction with Grayscale's stewardship of GBTC. Their core contention is that Grayscale's choices have culminated in substantial losses for investors.   David Bailey of BTC Inc and UTXO Management is spearheading this group of disgruntled shareholders. They have vocalized their demands, urging Grayscale to cut its management fee and facilitate investors in exchanging their shares directly for Bitcoin.   The Valkyrie Proposal   Meanwhile, Valkyrie Investments has introduced a bold proposition to seize control of GBTC. The Valkyrie strategy emphasizes bringing liquidity to GBTC, permitting investors to redeem their holdings. Simultaneously, they also expressed intentions to reduce the management fee from 2% to 0.75%.   Valkyrie has already started purchasing shares in GBTC as a part of its strategy. They aim to capitalize on the current ""massive discount"" of GBTC shares compared to the fund's underlying assets' net asset value (NAV).   The 5 key scenarios   1. If Grayscale wins its case, the discount will close, and DCG will probably become solvent as crypto prices increase. The best thing I could say about Grayscale is that they hold GBTC hostage to solve their other deeper problems and have some leverage for an ETF approval.   2. The Trust is sold or changes management in case DCG goes bankrupt or tries to raise some cash. Maybe they give it to Valkyrie, which stands to benefit a lot from the discount going down.   3. David Bailey and other investors force Grayscale to do some buybacks or redemptions without having to dissolve the entire trust. This could boost the price of GBTC and close the discount to a significant extent.   4. The trust is dissolved (quite unlikely), which has a catastrophic impact on crypto prices. It isn't just GBTC that's the issue, but ETHE too. Having to liquidate those funds directly would be really bad in the short to medium term, although long term, their effect on prices would be inconsequential.   5. As with scenario 4, an unlikely scenario would be DCG not going bankrupt while the SEC wins against Grayscale, but... later in 2024, Biden pushes for a crypto ETF when the SEC has better control over the industry. The discount closes as people speculate on it. My rationale is that Biden would want to win votes and please the crypto industry. Even if he doesn't do it, if DeSantis wins the elections (low chance), he could approve a Bitcoin ETF.   Conclusion   DCG has conducted criminal activity. GBTC holders had to pay the price, and nobody was there to help them. However, the discount has been decreasing as some major players/investors have been trying to improve the situation while benefiting from it themselves.   I see no scenario where the GBTC premium doesn't close within the next 24 months, although I believe it will have closed within the next year. Time is running out for the SEC and DCG; therefore, something will need to happen sooner. Currently, the GBTC discount is at 42%, which means that if it closes in the next 2 years, someone would have made a 70% gain on his BTC (assuming he held GBTC instead of BTC)."

One cannot ignore the challenges that Elon Musk and his team are currently facing, particularly the unveiling of the highly anticipated Cybertruck. While the Cybertruck's unique design may have captured attention, it has also sparked skepticism among investors and industry experts alike. The unconventional design has raised concerns about its mass-market appeal and potential impact on Tesla's overall sales.   As investors, it is crucial for us to carefully evaluate the situation and make informed decisions. In light of these recent developments, I believe it is essential to consider the option of shorting TSLA, as it may present an opportunity to mitigate potential losses. By shorting TSLA, we can capitalize on the current challenges the company is facing and potentially benefit from a decline in its stock value.   However, I urge you to conduct thorough research and consult with your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. While shorting TSLA may seem like a viable option, it is essential to consider the inherent risks associated with this strategy. Market volatility and unforeseen developments can significantly impact the outcome, so it is crucial to exercise caution and prudence.   In these uncertain times, it is essential to remember that the market is ever-changing, and opportunities can arise even amidst disappointment. By staying informed and making well-informed decisions, we can navigate these challenging waters with resilience and adaptability.   I encourage you to keep a close eye on Tesla's future developments, as they may offer insights into potential investment opportunities. Stay vigilant, analyze the market trends, and consider your risk tolerance before taking any action."

Currently $1.95 is an area of support, and it tested and confirmed this level as support on April 2023.   If price falls below $1.95, the next support level is the bottom of the channel at $1.11.

The chart on the left is a line chart with oscillators. Price has been trading within a range since February of 2023. (Yellow parallel channel) It's been bouncing between the $6.35 and $9.50 level. If price breaks below the $6.35 level, it would then test $5.00 as support. (Orange dashed line)   Looking at both the rsi and stochastics, strength and momentum are falling, and are in bearish territory. So there's a chance price could break below the parallel channel.

Too many people FOMO'd into that first spike through the supply line and the CO was not having it...   But really it needed to fill this gap before the big pamp.   Gap filled.... show time.   So what kind of target can we expect?   A run up to the 0.618 fib extension would be a pretty common retracement for a successful falling wedge breakout.   A near 130% increase from its current price.   For a different look, here are some historical levels (this chart is kinda fonky, so I zoomed out to the 3M chart to get some decent S/R based on candle closes)   That long wick at the top of wedge shows we have an imbalance... and what do we know about imbalances?   ....they often get revisited.   Does it have to. NO. But it wouldn't be weird.   Here's one more look with the fib extension overlaid   The historical levels make sense and line up pretty nicely.   A break of the 0.41 level would likely lead to run up to the 0.79 level and could very well give us that 0.786 fib extension.   Pump it."

The first 20D cycle trough of the second 40D cycle on Monday (October 16th).   Rejection of price by the 80D FLD: bearishness on TSLA.   May get a cross of 40D VTL confirming the peak of 80D cycle is in.   40D cycle trough: October 31st to November 6th (wave III bottom).   80D FLD gives a range of target: 207-233.   197.10 happening October 31st to November 6th.   Update:   From the peak of 268.94 on October 10th (we had predicted the peak as 268.5) to the close of today, we got a 21% move on TSLA in 10 days, congrats to anyone who played this amazing move based on the analysis that was published.   Analysis of the Structure:   Everything is perfectly on track, but I am doing a small relabeling to my count. I think we are already in wave (c) of y of 2. I am expecting the completion of wave III of (c) on Monday (the fib target is pointing to 208.31 for the low). Wave (c) of y can complete around 190 (when we get wave III and IV in the coming week, we can have a better idea about this target).   Analysis of the Cycles:   We got the 20D cycle trough on October 17th. Now, we are in the first 5D cycle of the first 10D cycle of the second 20D cycle of the second 40D cycle of the current 80D cycle.   We have already overshot all the FLD targets, so at this point they can not guide us to find the bottom price.   On Monday (23rd of October), we will get a 5D cycle trough. On Friday (October 27th) we will have a 10D trough and finally, on November 3rd or November 6th we will have the 80D cycle trough.   The next major trough, the 20W cycle is expected in the last week of December or the first week of January (wave (a) of z).   Note that we crossed the 20W VTL this week, confirming that the peak of the current 40W cycle is in, as we expected before (meaning that we will have 6-7 months of bearishness ahead of us).   The 20W FLD was also crossed this week, generating a target of 174 for that trough (wave (a) of z)."

What I'm proposing in terms of TA using EW, is that we are VERY close to that top (perhaps I will be wrong and it has already begun or perhaps it will never happen or perhaps it will happen years from now, time will tell. Safest bet is to manage risk and secure profits along the way).   1 pov I have is that we are ending the cycle of 5 waves up off the lows of 2009's bottom, which was the very start of a brand new cycle that has lasted nearly 14 straight years now. Sooner, or later, markets will mimick that style of ""dot-com bubble"" washout or ""the great crash"" of 1929.

We've got bad news from NVDA, TSLA, Banks, FED etc. So, shorting right here is kind of a no brainer; right?   Well, let's take a deeper look. On RSI, everytime there is a double touch on the lower end of bollinger bands, albeit during the last macro downtrend, there was a significant bounce. And both times there was a lower low. This time market is on a macro uptrend (yeah still it is, even though it is in an intermediate downtrend), and this week is still a higher low. The total regression hasn't been even to .618 level yet. There is a macro cup and handle still in works until price regresses more than 50%.   So is it time to load up on shorts or buy a whole bunch $300 puts? I am afraid, I won't be doing that. What I am intending to do is to wait for a bounce. $426 should be the failure point if market really wants to dump down to Oct 2022 lows. There are massive supports down below, so I don't expect market to do a nose dive as many are predicting. I will watch what happens next week and if we do get a bounce and a failure at $426, I will buy some downside options. For now, I am out on the sidelines."

2023-10-20 21:02:40,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/6uMZV6op-where-is-TSLA-s-support/,"Copy & Paste from IBD:   A slew of analysts lowered TSLA price targets after Q3 earnings as questions swirled around the company's near-term strategy and whether a growth stock works if its EPS is not jumping in 2024. Tesla stock has surged in 2023 as investors bet that the EV maker's growth story was intact, despite near-term growth woes.   Bank of America, Canaccord and Goldman Sachs were among the firms that cut Tesla stock price targets early Thursday on Q3 earnings.   Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, wrote Thursday that the earnings call was a ""mini disaster"" as Musk charted a cautious tack, warning Cybertruck production will take time and that he is concerned with the current economy.   Ives lowered his price target on Tesla stock to 310, from 350, noting there are near-term challenges around profit margins and volumes.   Bernstein sees Tesla looking increasingly like a ""regular auto company,"" based on the EV giant's Q3 balance sheet. The firm wrote Thursday that Tesla appears cautious on its near-to-medium growth prospects, indicating that it was ""reviewing all options"" for 2024. Bernstein believes TSLA may have to guide deliveries below consensus and face lower-than-expected margins in 2024.   Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also weighed in on Thursday. Last month Jonas wrote a bullish note on Tesla's full-self driving supercomputer. However, on Thursday Jonas took time to answer ""how can we defend a 'growth' stock that appears ready to enter its 2nd consecutive year of earnings decline.""   Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating and lowered his price target to 380, down from 400, on TSLA.   Jonas, in his research note, writes that Morgan Stanley views Tesla as much more than an auto company and is betting on Tesla's network services, mobility, third-party battery and full-self driving licensing along with its energy and insurance businesses.   ""Our OW (overweight) thesis is highly dependent upon these business lines becoming far greater drivers of earnings with clear milestones/proof-points backed by a"

For the past year the sock has been trading sideways with little action.   Maybe it's the copium talking, but I have suspicion that   VYGVQ   is not dead just yet.   Here are a few points to back up my hypothesis:   -There is a massive butterfly harmonic that just completed on the 3D chart   -U.S. regulators have charged Ex-CEO Steve Ehrlich for fraud and deliberately lying about customer asset protection. Funny things always happen with law suits and bankruptcy claim.   -The stock recently broke out of descending wedge with a massive wick up to 0.2, which makes me think some bigger money is entering. Could it be the Composite Operator? Ehrlich? An activist investor? Who knows. 0.2 and 0.5 are key levels to watch historically; straight up and straight down between these areas.   -Lastly, and maybe the most far reaching point yet, there is a prominent gap on the daily @ 1.92 meaning there is some trapped liquidity up there.   The gap occurred during a weekly transition which increases the odds of it being filled from my experience. Now it could take months, even years (potentially) for   VYGVQ   to reach that level again (if the stock doesn't die and get delisted, which could definitely happen).   Only time will tell.

2023-10-20 20:23:51,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/ENPH/rICqYVLR-Enphase-Energy/,"This is a chart of Enphase Energy (ENPH). For those who are not familiar with the company, Enphase Energy develops and manufactures microinverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry. They are one of the preeminent companies in solar power. Recently, price gapped up on the daily chart following news that Congress would pass legislation to fund sustainable infrastructure projects.   In the above chart, each candlestick represents a 6-month period. Analyzing higher timeframes can often help us determine trend reversals long before they happen. This higher timeframe chart reveals a very peculiar candlestick pattern: the sneaky bearish tri-star pattern.  This pattern occurs when three Doji candlesticks form after a bull run. This pattern can warn that a major reversal is coming. See below image.   A bearish tri-star pattern is an insidious topping pattern that Wall Street smart money would love for you to not know about. In short, it appears because Wyckoff distribution is occurring underneath the surface.   While I cannot describe the entirety of Wyckoff distribution in this post, I can say that, in short, Wyckoff distribution is when smart money gradually distributes or sells their shares near the top. The gradual nature of the selloff traps the unsuspecting ""weak hands"" (mostly small retail traders) who buy while unaware that the bull run is in its final phase. Sometimes, since smart money is especially manipulative, they manufacture a sudden upthrust in price near the end of the Wyckoff distribution, which may be what's happening right now.   This sudden upthrust (UT or UTAD) is a price move above resistance that quickly reverses and closes lower. The upthrust is a test of the remaining demand. It is also a bull trap: It appears to signal the resumption of the bull run but in reality, is intended to trick uninformed breakout traders. A UT or UTAD allows Wall Street smart money to mislead the public about the future trend direction and, subsequently, sell additional shares at elevated prices to breakout traders before the markdown begins. In addition, a UTAD may induce smaller traders in short positions to cover and surrender their shares to the larger interests who have engineered this move.   In my years of trading experience I have seen the above chart many times before, and the result is almost always the same. This chart is in the phase that some of us traders call a ""fake out"". A fake out occurs when price appears to be breaking out when actually it is just forming an upper wick. This occurs when price has been moving within an ascending wedge and after bearish divergence has occurred on the RSI. The final phase is when the RSI breaks out after bearish divergence and while in overbought territory. Price then pulls back down strongly and a long upper wick forms on the candlestick. In essence, this is just another way of visualizing the upthrust phase of Wyckoff distribution. The final RSI breakout is the UTAD of Wyckoff distribution.   Here's another Trading View user who is apparently seeing the same thing as I am, though this post is from before the current upthrust:   Also worth mentioning is that it is interesting that corporate insiders have been only selling their positions and there has been no reported insider buying for nearly a year (see below). This is not usually predictive of future price action, but it can give a general sense of sentiment among insiders at a company.   So it's worth watching to see if ENPH will reverse downward. Perhaps it will blast through this level and my analysis prove wrong. As a trader, you must always be willing to accept when you're wrong because your money is more important than your ego. With that said, just remember this is a long-term chart and price may continue moving up before reversing down. Some related charts, including the charts of ETFs that hold ENPH and the ENPH/SPY relative chart, suggest that ENPH does have the momentum necessary to break out to the upside. It's just looking very suspicious right now.   This post is not making a short call on ENPH, it is just an observation. It is not financial advice. Although I may choose to open a position, at the time of writing this, I have neither a long nor a short position open on ENPH. This is an objective, non-biased analysis.   I'll be keeping an investigative eye on this chart."

On this date, the S&P 500 closed at $4,243.25, marking a decrease of 0.62%. The technical analysis indicated that the S&P 500 was trading between the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) above, and the 200-Day EMA below, which typically suggests a lot of market noise. The analysis also hinted at the formation of a rising wedge, which could be a bearish pattern. This choppiness in the market was attributed to the ongoing earnings season and other macroeconomic factors.

2023-10-20 18:53:04,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/EEFT/EMKEiGZr-Unveiling-Euronet-Worldwide-EEFT-s-Value/,"Euronet Worldwide Inc (NASDAQ:EEFT) has recently seen a daily gain of 7.19%, despite a 3-month loss of -28.27%. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 5.23, the question arises - is the stock significantly undervalued?   Euronet Worldwide Inc operates as a provider of electronic financial transaction solutions. The company's network spans across Europe, offering an independent network of ATMs, a network for prepaid products such as mobile top-ups, and processing point-of-sale transactions. Euronet Worldwide also offers global money transfers, payment services and software, banking services, credit and debit card outsourcing services, and card issuing and merchant acquiring services. The company's largest segment by operating income, electronical financial transaction processing, mainly generates revenue from monthly ATM management fees and currency conversion transactions. The largest country by revenue is the United States of America.   With a current stock price of $82.48, it's essential to compare this with the company's GF Value, an estimation of fair value. This comparison will pave the way for a more profound exploration of the company's value, ingeniously integrating financial assessment with essential company details.   Financial Strength   Companies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, an investor must do their research and review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to understand its financial strength. Euronet Worldwide has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1, which ranks worse than 65.25% of 2734 companies in the Software industry. The overall financial strength of Euronet Worldwide is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Euronet Worldwide is fair.   Profitability and Growth   Investing in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Euronet Worldwide has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $3.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.23. Its operating margin is 11.8%, which ranks better than 76.03% of 2762 companies in the Software industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Euronet Worldwide at 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability."

Nearly a quarter of households with children plan to travel for vacation this holiday season, with cruises and resorts among top destinations.   CHICAGO, Oct. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- More than half of Americans (51%) plan to spend more than $500 this holiday shopping season, a marked increase from the 36% who planned to do so in 2022. A new TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) report found that three in 10 consumers (29%) plan on spending more on holiday shopping than in the year prior, while only 16% say they will spend less.   Both data points represent the third consecutive year for their respective trends, indicating continuing consumer resiliency. The findings were corroborated by the amounts consumers plan to spend this year, with significant increases in the higher spend brackets. The shift was even more exaggerated in the drop at the lower end of planned spending.   Consumer tolerance for security depends on in-store vs. online   The past year saw several high-profile smash and grab attacks on retailers, causing many to place more products inside security cases to prevent organized retail crime. While the majority of consumers (66%) say they havent noticed or dont care that more products are being locked up, one-third of consumers dislike the practice.   In fact, 15% said they wont wait to have an item unlocked by a store employee; 9% will instead purchase those items online; and another 9% will generally carry a negative view of the store. These findings vary slightly across regions in the U.S., with higher levels of negative feelings in the Northeast and West, which have been more highly affected by theft and organized retail crime.   Consumers are far less ambivalent about online security measures as they protect the consumers as well as the retailers. In fact, 96% of shoppers have a positive or at least neutral view of additional security measures. Six in 10 (59%) say added security makes them more likely to shop with that retailer and 37% say they are willing to spend the time to verify their identity without it affecting their shopping habits.   However, there was one point on which both groups agreed, which is that two-factor authentication is the top choice for online shopping security measures.   About TransUnion (NYSE: TRU)   TransUnion is a global information and insights company with over 12,000 associates operating in more than 30 countries.

2023-10-20 16:43:03,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/RGEN/8u8ikxGf-Repligen-RGEN-s-Hidden-Value/,"Despite a daily loss of 3.9% and a 3-month loss of 3.4%, Repligen Corp (NASDAQ:RGEN) shows a promising Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 2.42. This raises a compelling question: Is the stock significantly undervalued?   Repligen Corp is a leading life sciences company with a global presence. It is renowned for developing and commercializing innovative bioprocessing technologies and systems that enhance efficiencies in manufacturing biological drugs. With a broad customer base ranging from life science companies to global biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturers, Repligen markets its products worldwide. The majority of its revenue is generated in North America.   With a current stock price of $147.19 per share and a market cap of $8.20 billion, it's critical to compare these figures with the GF Value, which is an estimation of fair value. This comparison will pave the way for a deeper exploration of the company's value.   Understanding GF Value   The GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.   Repligen (NASDAQ:RGEN) appears to be significantly undervalued. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given Repligen's current price and market cap, the stock shows every sign of being significantly undervalued.   Because Repligen is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.   Assessing Financial Strength   Before investing in a company, it's crucial to assess its financial strength. Investing in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a great insight into a company's financial strength. Repligen has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.43, which is lower than 59.01% of 832 companies in the Medical Devices & Instruments industry. However, the overall financial strength of Repligen is 8 out of 10, indicating strong financial health."

(Safe background and very good dividend system. ) It seems to be working on a bearish pattern now, which is projecting a decline all the way to the $140 zone.   For me, it's the only stock I've held long since the $90 level, and I've been buying regularly ever since. It's like Coca-Cola to Warren Buffett to me. (Only I have a little less of it.)   For me, this seems like a good point for my long haul bags. If this pattern works, the price will reach the target zone by winter. If you have to choose between Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson, P&G is clearly better in the long run.   Do not forget. These are my thoughts and observations about the market. And they do not constitute investment advice. Also, do your own research before entering a position.   Tell me what you think, and if you like my idea, share it with others.

We have a falling broadening  wedge, on which we had a breakout already. This is part of a bigger falling wedge (blue).   It is techincally possible, we had put in the lows at 6.35 as a wave 5 (as an ending diagonal), which is part of wave V as a last wave, of the biggest Wave (II). This would indicate, for quiet a few years we have the lows.   Now, it is possible (~20%) that the wave(II) can extend, and that currently what we are forming is just a wave(IV) as a bigger ABC correction, but we should NOT ignore this good opportunity.   In the primary scenarion (bottom is in place): we already had a 5 count up (sorry for the inconsistency in the colors and the letterd counts) as a diagonal, completing the orange wave I (or wave A) up, and now, alongside with the news that shares are issued, we are having the orange wave II as an abc pullback. Due to the impulsiveness, this is certanly an a wave down, and it does not seem finished yet. It will be followed by a b wave up, and then agan a c wave down.   I have marked the turnaround/support boxes.   Possibly, with the abc we could form a head and shoulders (but target wont be reached). We would like to have the turnaround optimally in the green box. It could have a deeper pullback, so chances are, it will drop to the orange box. (I am scaling in)   Under the orange box is what I call the ""danger"" zone; it COULD still turn around, but more often than not, it is just not playing out, and being extremely risky, signaling, that possibly new lows are coming   I have already made 3 positions opened between 8-9 USD from previous months (accumulation)   Strong support (which will be my scale in zones for further accumulation):   ~8.80   ~8.40   ~7.75   I am also swing trading it(several days->weeks, shorting/buying) on a short frame based on elliott counts/luxalgo/support zones/MA's. (i.e.: if a wave seems done, put in a hedged long for 3 counts up for b wave, then short it down hedged till .618 OR 5 counts down)   On the daily:   RSI is cooling down from overbought levels, and MACD possibly diverging (already converged)   200 day MA is rejecting us,180 as well.   15day SMA, 21day EMA, 9day SMA rejected us.   50/52 day SMA is below us, but with the bottoming/pullback likely we will sip below that (but converging upwards)   On the weekly:   we getting rejected for a while on the 9.85 levels, indicating a pullback for many weeks now (again, my primary scenario it wants just a wave 2 pullback in)   RSI is pulling back, but have not diverged with the trendline, and possibly will not, i expect to provide support   MACD is coming up nicely to the base level, but deccelerating.   Invalidation for the setup is the brushed yellow line."

The fact that side effects have developed worldwide due to the Covid vaccine and many people have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies probably also plays a role in this deep decline.   There is a lot of money in the pharmaceutical industry, so I think that the companies will have plenty of money to cover possible legal costs. And since in several countries they have signed papers that they request the vaccination on their own responsibility, the exclusion of liability will be justified in many cases.   The $30 zone seems like a perfect turning point because I see it as a strong level. If the $30 zone holds, we will most likely look at the $40 zone, which also coincides with an important Fibonacci level.   Do not forget. This does not constitute investment advice. Do your own research before entering a position.   Regards   In extreme cases, the $27 level is also possible."

2023-10-20 15:28:25,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/QQQ/rfjXpZjh-Which-ticker-has-higher-chance-of-moving-Upward/,"Price action at the lower border of an upward channel has a higher chance of moving upward than price action at the upper border of a downward channel. This is because an upward channel is formed by higher highs and higher lows, which indicates an uptrend. When the price reaches the lower border of the channel, it finds support at a previous level and is more likely to bounce back and continue the uptrend.   On the other hand, a downward channel is formed by lower highs and lower lows, which indicates a downtrend. When the price reaches the upper border of the channel, it encounters resistance at a previous level and is more likely to be rejected and continue the downtrend.   Of course, there is no guarantee that price will always move in the expected direction. However, the technical analysis principles described above suggest that price action at the lower border of an upward channel has a higher chance of moving upward than price action at the upper border of a downward channel.   It is important to note that price action is just one factor to consider when making trading decisions. Other factors, such as overall market conditions and fundamental analysis, should also be considered."

Conversely, if the stock price falls below the bearish line located at $96.19:   Bearish Target Price 1: $94.75, which could act as a support level based on the previous low point (Right Shoulder).

(NYSE: W)   Trend and Moving Averages:   The stock price seems to be trading below its moving averages, indicating a prevailing bearish sentiment.   However, there's a recent upward movement, suggesting a potential bullish reversal.   Support and Resistance:   Bullish Line: Around $45.52, which seems to be a short-term support line the stock is currently trying to maintain.   Bearish Line: At $44.13, acting as the next support below.   Target Price 1: The bearish target is set at $43.36.   Target Price 2: The bullish target is marked at $46.70.   Volume:   There are some significant volume spikes, which can be considered bullish if they coincide with the upward price movements.   RSI (Relative Strength Index):   The RSI line seems to be on the rise, hovering around the mid-line (50). This suggests a balance between buying and selling pressure, with a slight tilt towards a bullish momentum.   MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):   The MACD line has recently crossed above the signal line, which is a bullish signal. The positive divergence indicates increasing bullish momentum.   Observation:   The stock seems to be showing signs of a potential bullish reversal, as indicated by the recent upward trend and the bullish signals from the MACD.   If the stock can maintain its position above the bullish line at $45.52 and witness increased buying volume, it may attempt to reach the target price of $46.70.

The long blue bar shows a strong bullish movement in one of the 15-minute intervals, but it seems the momentum could not be maintained, as the price started declining shortly after.   Moving Averages:   There are two moving averages, one short-term (potentially 50-period) and one long-term (potentially 200-period). The stock price is currently below both, which is generally a bearish signal.   The moving averages appear to be converging slightly towards the end, potentially indicating a change in trend in the future if they crossover.   Volume:   There's a significant spike in volume during the bullish move. This suggests that there was strong buying interest during that time.   Following the bullish spike, the volume seems to taper off, which can be an indication of a decrease in trading interest or momentum.   Support and Resistance Levels:   The ""Bullish Line"" is set at 53.48, which might act as a resistance level in the short term. If the price breaks above this with significant volume, it could lead to further bullish movement.   The ""Bearish Line"" is marked at 52.49. This might serve as a short-term support level. A breach below this line could indicate further downward movement.   Target prices are set at various levels, with the nearest being Target Price 1 at 52.06, then 51.37, and the lowest being 50.69. These could serve as potential support levels or price targets for a bearish move.   On the upside, if there's a change in trend, the target prices are 54.57 and 55.28.   RSI (Relative Strength Index):   The RSI seems to be hovering around the mid-level, currently at 42.70, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.   The movement of the RSI is generally flat, suggesting no strong momentum in either direction at the moment.   Overall Sentiment:   The overall sentiment from this chart seems to be slightly bearish, considering the price is below both moving averages and is closer to the bearish line.   However, the RSI is near the middle, and the moving averages are converging, so there could be potential for a change in trend. It would be crucial to watch for breakouts above resistance or breakdowns below support, coupled with volume, for a clearer direction."

This suggests bullish momentum.   Candlesticks:   We see a mix of bullish and bearish candles, but the bullish candles are larger in body, suggesting stronger buying pressure.   The large blue candlestick in the recent period might indicate strong buying interest.   Moving Averages:   The stock is trading above both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish indicator.   The moving averages are also in an upward trajectory, further affirming the bullish momentum.   Support and Resistance:   Bullish Line (Resistance turned Support): The stock has broken above the ""Bullish Line"" at 116.77 USD, turning it into a potential support.   Bearish Line (Resistance): At 115.23 USD, if the stock moves downwards, this could be a resistance point to watch.   Price Targets:   Target Price 1: 113.80 USD - If there's a pullback, this could be a potential lower target.   Target Price 2: 111.56 USD - A further downward target if the stock faces more selling pressure.   Target Price 1: 118.50 USD - An upward target if the bullish momentum continues.   Target Price 2: 119.78 USD - A higher potential target with continued bullish activity.   Volume:   A significant spike in volume accompanies the large bullish candlestick, suggesting strong buying interest.   RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI is hovering around the middle range. It's not in the overbought or oversold territories, suggesting that there's room for the stock to move in either direction.   Summary:   The stock shows signs of bullish momentum, with strong buying interest evident from the recent large bullish candlestick and the upward trend. The break above the Bullish Line is a positive sign. However, it's essential to watch for potential pullbacks towards the bearish line and monitor the stock's movement in conjunction with real-world news or financial data related to Philips 66."

2023-10-20 14:21:05,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/MSTR/EfVa6KcY-Wall-Street-Bulls-Look-Optimistic-About-MicroStrategy-MSTR/,"MicroStrategy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by five brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.   While the ABR calls for buying MicroStrategy, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.   Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.   This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.   With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."

Eli Lilly on Thursday said it sued 11 online pharmacies to stop them from importing, selling and distributing products claiming to contain the active ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro, which is expected to be approved for weight loss later this year.   The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said the suit will go to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).   It names the U.S.-based Artic Peptides, Strate Labs, Supopeptide, The Triggered Brand, and Unewlife as defendants, along with Britains Biolabshop, Spains Super Human Store and Steroide Kaufen in Poland. Chinas Audrey Beauty, Mew Mews Company and AustroPeptide were also targeted in the complaint.   Lilly said testing of AustroPeptides product purporting to contain the Mounjaro main ingredient tirzepatide showed it actually was nothing more than sugar alcohol.   The U.S. ITC has the power issue import bans against products that violate certain parts of U.S. trade law and to take them off the market once they have entered the country.   Once the complaint is published in the Federal Register, the commission will have 30 days to decide whether to accept it or not.   Lilly is accusing the online pharmacies of infringing its trademark for Mounjaro, falsely associating themselves with Lilly and approved tirzepatide, and making false or misleading statements in their advertisements related to tirzepatide.   The unapproved drug products are dangerous research chemicals that are not approved for human consumption and have no connection to Eli Lilly or Mounjaro, Lilly said in its lawsuit.   Lilly is the only company with U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell tirzepatide products."
2023-10-20 10:50:42,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/SPY/gZfrgoVZ-SPY-GEX-levels-Morning-of-10-20-OPEX/,"Here is an updated technical analysis of SPY, the S&P 500 ETF Trust, based on some of the most popular indicators and tools as of October 20, 2023:   - The SPY is trading at **$431.52** as of October 13, 2023, down **0.50%** from the previous close of **$433.66**.   - The SPY is in a **bearish** trend according to the moving averages, as it is trading below all the exponential moving averages (EMAs) of 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day. The 20-day EMA is acting as a dynamic resistance level, while the 200-day EMA is acting as a dynamic support level.   - The SPY is also in a **bearish** zone according to the oscillators, as most of them are showing sell signals. The relative strength index (RSI) is at **41.77%**, indicating that the SPY is oversold and could bounce back soon. The stochastic %K and %D are both at **25.24%**, indicating that the SPY is in a bearish crossover and could continue to decline. The average directional index (ADX) is at **16.92%**, indicating that the SPY is in a weak trend.   - The SPY has broken below the **symmetrical triangle** pattern on the daily chart, which is a continuation pattern that indicates a period of consolidation before a breakout in either direction. The triangle has been forming since July 2023, and the SPY broke below the lower trendline of the triangle at around **$428** on October 18, 2023. This signals a bearish breakdown and a potential target of **$404**, which is the height of the triangle subtracted from the breakdown point.   - The SPY has a strong correlation with the VIX, which is a measure of implied volatility in the S&P 500 options market. The VIX is often used as a fear gauge, as it tends to rise when investors are uncertain or fearful about the market direction. The VIX is currently at **18.75%**, which is slightly below its historical average of **19.04%**. This indicates that investors are moderately cautious and nervous about the market outlook. However, the VIX could spike higher if there are any unexpected events or shocks that trigger market volatility.   In summary, the SPY is in a bearish state according to both the moving averages and the oscillators, and it has broken below a symmetrical triangle pattern that could lead to further downside. The VIX is moderate, indicating some market fear, but it could change quickly if there are any surprises or uncertainties. Therefore, traders should watch for any signs of a reversal or continuation from the breakdown level, and use appropriate risk management strategies to protect their positions.

2023-10-20 09:44:18,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NKE/eFbXyUF1-NIKE-JUST-BUY-IT/,"Nike topped Wall Street estimates for first quarter profit on Thursday as higher prices of its sneakers and apparel helped offset a hit from waning demand and persistent cost pressures, sending its shares up about 8% in extended trading.   Nike (NKE) is the largest apparel company in the world, with leading positions across different categories and regions. The company is currently facing challenges such as elevated inventory levels, inflationary pressure, and slow growth in China. Such issues have resulted in the stock dropping by 19% YTD. Although these headwinds are serious, I believe the company's durable brand, leading position, and high-quality products should allow it to come out stronger on the other end.   'Nike is a brand that is of China and for China' -John Donahoe   Like every other apparel and retail company, Nike thought post-pandemic demand would continue, so it increased production, which led to inventory levels hitting an all-time high in Q1-FY22, but as we know, that wasn't the case. Although NKE's inventory level is down from all-time highs, investors are still concerned, especially when inflation is eating into people's pockets and growth in China is slowing.   Inflation in North America has come down to 3.7% from its peak in June at 9.1%, but it is still a concern in Europe (6.1% in the EU union). As you can see from the graph below, sales in China have been decreasing for the past two years. There are multiple ways one can explain this: COVID related lockdowns resulted in the shuttering of some stores. Plus, Nike and other apparel companies started facing a backlash in China in 2021 due to the alleged use of forced labor in cotton production. However, if the company is successful at expanding into China, then we can expect a lot of room for growth.   Now that I have addressed the problems that are facing Nike, let me explain why I believe the company will overcome them. Nike sponsors the most well-known athletes such as Cristiano Ronaldo (+600 million Instagram followers), LeBron James, Michael Jordan, the late Kobe Bryant, Rafael Nadal, Tiger Woods, and more. This has helped the company build a loyal customer base and further boost its brand equity. With a loyal customer base comes pricing power, and as Warrant Buffet said:   Nike's pricing power is no joke. Its shoes have reached a level where they are considered luxury, with some selling for more than the $10,000 mark. In 2017, Nike's median price for a shoe regardless of gender was $80, which is $10 more than its biggest competitor, Adidas. I know 2017 was a long time ago, but shoe prices have increased since then, and I believe Nike is still in the lead given their dominant market position. Plus, Nike targets mostly the age demographic of 25 and 34. These are people who have not settled in yet. They just graduated college with extra income to spend on things such as expensive shoes. I believe this pricing power will continue as the company continues to sponsor talented upcoming athletes to build trust with customers.   Another way to measure Nike's brand power is by comparing its marketing spending against its peers. Nike's marketing budget in FY 23 was $4 billion, or 7.9% of revenue. On the other hand, Adidas spent 38% and Under Armour 11%. These companies have been allocating more of their revenue towards marketing but have experienced nowhere near the growth Nike has. NKE's association with well-known athletes in the U.S. has allowed them to have a 96% awareness rate, 53% usage rate, and 43% loyalty rate. Going forward, I expect the company's brand will remain high-quality due to sponsorships, high-quality products, and market-leading technology.   Founded by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight in 1994, Nike has come a long way from its first store in Portland, Oregon. As of May 31, 2023, the company had 369 stores within the U.S. and 663 internationally, operating in more than 190 countries. Stores include franchised stores and third-party retailers. The firm owns multiple brands such as Jordan, Converse, and Nike. The company derives sales from four main segments and across four regions. I excluded Converse (4.74% of revenue) from the graphs below because I wanted to focus on the Nike brand. The company's app, NikePlus, has more than 160 million users.   On a trailing free cash flow basis, the stock yields over 3.3% relative to its enterprise value. My ~$104 May 24 PT implies a 28.00x P/E and 20.00x EV/EBITDA. Both multiples are below the ten-year NTM average and in line with the median. I project revenue to compound at a rate of 6.47% over the next three years, driven by market growth and new products, while shares decrease at a rate of 2.67%, driven by stock buybacks. The company is forecast to spend $12.1 billion on share repurchases over the same period.   Additionally, I believe the company still has room for margin improvement driven by price increases and DTC mix (direct-to-consumer). In FY 2019, DTC sales constituted 31% of revenue, and that figure stood at 44% in FY 2023. Although NKE is trading at a premium compared to peers, I believe it is reasonable considering its scale, high-quality products, and strong brand.   The first risk that I would associate with NKE is competition. The company competes with conglomerates such as Addidas, Puma, New Balance, Under Armour, and more. Additionally, e-commerce has made it very easy for anyone to start their own footwear brand. Other key risks to my rating include supply chain distributions, a recessionary environment, and slow growth in China.   Finally, we can point out that NKE appears technically oversold heading into the Q1 earnings report. From the chart , there has been relentless selling pressure over the last four months since NKE was trading at $130 per share.   The potential that NKE delivers a ""good"" earnings report with encouraging guidance, brushing aside fears the company is facing a deeper deterioration in its operating environment could be enough for shares to reprice higher. Simply put, our take is that NKE bears have gone too far, opening the door for bulls to take control.   The bottom line is that Nike is currently experiencing headwinds such as elevated inventory levels, inflationary pressure, and slow growth in China. Every business goes through similar challenges at one time or another, but I believe Nike is well-positioned to overcome these issues due to its durable brand, high-quality products, and leading position. I expect the company to keep endorsing high-quality athletes to elevate its brand equity and further strengthen its pricing power. My valuation implies a price target of ~$104 for May 31, 2024.   If you into NIKE brand you can watch Air film and read Shoe Dog book as well"
2023-10-20 09:42:55,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TTWO/LOnrOAgd-Take-Two-TTWO-GTA-VI/,"Is TakeTwo Interactive Software Fairly Valued?   We use what is known as a 2 stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.   Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US $9.1b   The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.   The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$27b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$139, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.   We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Take-Two Interactive Software as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.071. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.   Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Take-Two Interactive Software, we've put together three pertinent items you should explore:   Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Take-Two Interactive Software   Future Earnings: How does TTWO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Their product portfolio includes a range of therapies in various therapeutic areas, such as diabetes, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and other medical conditions.   One notable aspect of their recent success is the introduction of a weight loss drug, tirzepatide. This drug is similar to other medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are also designed to help with weight loss. These medications are administered via weekly injections and work by affecting the patient's appetite by mimicking certain hormones in the gut.   Wegovy, for instance, primarily mimics the hunger-regulating hormone called GLP-1, while tirzepatide goes a step further by mimicking both GLP-1 and another hormone called GIP. These hormonal effects can lead to decreased appetite, making it easier for individuals to manage their weight."

But that's my long term view:   TQQQ made 200x since inception in February 2010 until his top in November 2021.   Now, in my opinion, we are in the middle of a Bear Market.   My expectation is that this Bear Market will last till December 22 until June 23.   After that the next Bull market should start.   My expectation for the Nasdaq 100 is to trade around 47.500 Points after this 10 Year Bull Market, which would take the TQQQ to around 1000.   This would equal a 100x from the Bear Market lows, which I expect around 10.   Of course no one can predict the future but I would also be happy with just 50x in 10 Years :D   And I really think that this is a possible scenario.   So here is my plan:   in December 2022 i will start investing all of my money into TQQQ.   For the next 5 years i will put everything into TQQQ too.

2023-10-20 04:00:42,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TLT/FJ1qPOWd-Watch-TLT-Support-at-Multi-Decade-Lows/,"Primary Chart   : Monthly Chart of TLT Showing Multi-Decade Support Levels.   A fair amount of charts have been published lately on the importance of interest rates, and conversely, long-term bonds, government or high-yield bonds. One well-known TradingView publisher   @scheplick   went so far as to describe the chart of the US 10-year yield as the most important chart for understanding financial markets in this season. His post was entitled, ""   The Most Important Chart in the World   :   TLT is an iShares ETF that tracks the performance, generally speaking of long-term US Treasury bonds. Specifically, iShares describes TLT as an ETF that ""seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities greater than twenty years.""   TLT has been in a severe downtrend since March 2020. Bonds yields move inversely to price, and TLT represents, in a rough sense, the price of an index or basket of long-term US government bonds with maturities greater than 20 years. So if long-term bonds remain in a downtrend, then this corresponds to the uptrend in long-term yields that has continued to break higher than anyone expects.   The Primary Chart shows TLT having reached long-term, major support at 2009-2010 lows. But a careful examination of TLT's recent lows reveals that it broke slightly below those lows, which isn't a good look for bond bulls in the long term. Supplementary Chart A shows 2009-2010 lows  on a monthly chart (similar to the Primary Chart above).   Supplementary Chart A   However, TLT's reaching such a major support level, with a lower wick forming (at least initially), could imply a move higher in bonds and a concomitant move lower in yields in the near term. But remember that fighting a predominant trend (mean reversion) when it becomes extended can be one of the trades having the lowest success rate. But it can also have a higher reward rate if risk is managed well. SquishTrade does not recommend being long bonds here but rather commenting on how traders may react to major support levels in TLT's downtrend. They may be right or wrongrecall that no one likely expected long bonds to fall as far as they have, and many have been positioned long bonds since TLT was in the upper $90s!   The next few supplementary charts emphasize the nature and severity of the downtrend in long-term bonds, as represented here by TLT. The first shows TLT's 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Price is about 12.11% below the 200-day SMA as of mid-session on Friday, September 29/   Supplementary Chart B   Next, the VWAP anchored to TLT's long-term cycle high is shown in black. This confirms a long-term, and extreme downtrend in long duration US Treasury bonds. Long-term VWAPs do not always have such a noticeable downward slope. Even a bounce to $125 could present just a mean reversion (retracement) within this downtrend despite creating an uptrend on the daily or even weekly chart, which would be necessary to reach that distant level.   Supplementary Chart C   A Fibonacci channel below has been applied to a weekly TLT chart. Notice how the channel shows support right where the weekly lower wick formedthe 1.618 level of the channel. To be sure, this does not necessitate a long-term trend reversal (though anything is possible, and this could be the spot). But it does suggest the potential for a near term bounce in the shorter cycles.   Supplementary Chart D   Anyone wondering whether a long-term uptrend is still in place from the start of TLT's price history should consider the following chart. This shows decisive breaks of several long-term (and progressively accelerating) uptrends.   Supplementary Chart E   Year-end flows can be supportive of equities, though not alwaysnote the late 2019 exception for   SPX   and $NASDAQ:NDX. If some relief materializes in long-term to intermediate-term bonds, then this could coincide with some support in broader equity markets into year end, though this is by no means guaranteed.   Consider the following posts and charts on yield curve inversions posted by   @SpyMasterTrades   and this author on TradingView:   These charts of yield-curve inversions should give one serious concerns about the near-term (3 months to 2 years) health of the stock market.   This post is in no way advocating any particular investing or trading strategy. Short-term trading and long-term investing can both be either devastating or profitable (or somewhere in between those extremes) to the person engaging in it.

2023-10-20 03:17:19,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BKF/CuRXBBmw-BRIC-Replacing-The-US-Is-Silly/,"There has been a lot of propaganda of late talking about the BRICs will replace the US   or China Yuan will etc.. this is flat-out silly talk designed to influence unsuspecting   people for political purposes.   This chart BKF/SPY is a comparison chart BRIC and the US. However, BRIC is now BIC   since Russia has been cut out by US sanctions. In my view, BIC is appropriate Flick my BIC   used to be a commercial for lighters back in the day. FLICK is all that BIC can do. Why?   1. US has only 5% of the Global population which produces 25% of the Global GDP.   No BRIC country can even compare.   2. US is not going to be invaded by Mexico, Canada, or Cuba.   3. The Global economy cannot function without a World reserve stable currency. For that   to occur a currency must I repeat MUST be able to be a net import thereby EXPORTING $s   to the rest of the world and still, reaching max employment of 3.5%. In other words, US   production & consumption is so high we need to export low-level jobs to other parts of the   world to meet our consumption demands while freeing up labor to do more technologically   advanced production. Not a single BRIC nation can even come close to matching the US in this   regard.   4. BRIC has a long history who will print more relative to their counterparts rendering their   currency worthless relative to the USD. Even China with 1.4 Billion people are totally dependent   on US consumption. China only floats 2% of the Yuan currently. totally insufficient to meet global   demand even if people desired it. Floating the Yuan for China and leaving it to market forces to   value it would be a complete disaster for the totalitarian Regime.   5. BRIC are well known for their rampant corruption problems. its one thing to agree we all hate   the US and another, to agree with themselves on what the rate of their currency is. Honestly, they   would kill each other at the onset.   All those who disagree are more than welcome to put their money where their mouth is and go out   and buy BIC. It's one thing to say what you believe and another to have skin in the game and accept   the financial consequences in what they say and believe.   As the great poet Mike Tyson Famously said ""Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth"".   Don't be fooled by propagandists and lose your hard-earned money!"

They are powerful moves which give little room for entry/exit. When you're on the right side of them though, man they feel good. Thats why you will hear me mention from time to time that I prefer to trade wave 3's & C's. This C-wave for instance, has dropped   $83 in 34 days   .   Thats almost a 30% drop in market drop...in 1 month.   That, my friends, is a C-wave. The funny thing about it, it's not even done. I have been calling for a sub $200 drop since the top & look were everything points to.   I think the indices will play a big role in how far Tesla extends to the down side. However, I stand by my view point I have had for over a month now, and that is we are headed to the low $180's as our most likely bottom for this C wave. After that Tesla is headed to the moon. I assume the indices will be needing a retrace higher around that time and Tesla will help drive it up. If you think about it there are many, many, many reasons for Tesla stock to soar. One that not many are talking about that will revolutionize taxi services...FSD. When this goes wide (only a matter of time) people can literally use their Tesla's as an autonomous taxi while they are at work, sleeping, on vacation, whatever it may be. Bye uber, Bye Turo, Bye every ride sharing company/taxi service out there. This doesn't even scratch the surface of the safety value this adds to everyone. I didn't even mention the power storage, solar power, robots, etc etc. Anyway, just some food for thought.   As far as the analysis there isn't much to add. We extended down to the 1.236 fib line and have some major pos div on the 3min chart along with others. We should start to carve out wave iv tomorrow and raise to the low $230's hopefully tomorrow but NLT Monday (this is a guestimate). Remember the further this extends down the more it pulls wave iv's target down with it. After iv comes v, and it should tag around the 1.382-1.618 fib @ $211.65 - $203.17. That will finish out wave iii of (3) of C and then wave (4) of C starts.   I work again tomorrow so I might not have much time again to watch it. If I make any trades, I will post them on here as always. Good Luck!   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler"

Here, I'm using short puts as an acquisitional tool, attempting to acquire shares in multi-year weakness, after which I'll proceed to cover the shares with short calls.  The short call premium, along with TLT's monthly dividend, will result in positive cash flow.   There are a couple of different approaches I could utilize here to manage the shares I'm assigned, one of which is to sell a call against each individual lot I'm assigned, laddering out short calls in time as I'm assigned shares.  Since I've got quite a few contracts subject to assignment, this would result in sort of a covered call spaghetti-works.   Another simpler approach would be to see what the average cost basis of all the lots I'm assigned is, and then proceed to sell calls at or above that average cost basis in a single expiry.  For example, the average cost basis of the two rungs shown here is (89 + 93)/2 or 91/share.  With that cost basis in mind, I would proceed to sell two calls at or above the 91 strike at a reasonably delta'd strike in an expiry that's paying.  Given the distance price has pulled away from my likely average cost basis, the calls are likely to be somewhat long dated.   Given the fact that my highest short put strike is at 94, I'm more likely to sell calls at 94 initially, wait to be assigned everything that I'm going to get assigned, look at the average cost basis at that point and then adjust the short calls accordingly.  Because of its simplicity, this is the approach I'll be going with, looking to stay in the shares and manage the entire position on a fairly long-term basis.   As usual, we'll see how it goes ... ."

The Jan '25 77 short call finished the day at around 43 delta, and -- as with all my covered calls, I'll look to roll out the short call at intervals, with an eye toward keeping the short call at or above the 30 delta and/or leaving it alone if price pops back above my break even.   Unfortunately, the position becomes somewhat ""dead money"" for a bit since the current next available expiries to roll to are limited to June '25, Dec '25, and Jan '26 (although I can certainly roll down intraexpiry if push comes to shove)."

Before that, it will have to previously exceed the medium-term bullish guideline (June 2019) in the vicinity of $175.   1 W   In the short term, prices present a series of supports that will initially stop the falls. The   important liquidity zone   between $200-220 and the 200-session average ($196) will help to contain the falls and   will probably enter a sideways phase that will last a few weeks   . It will then most likely attack the June 2019 bullish trendline.   1 D   In June of this year there was a   bearish gap   ($280 to $290) not yet covered that will act as a strong resistance in the future. A new bearish gap has been experienced during the day which has determined the   loss of the 200 session average   .   4 h   In the very short term the   bullish gap   from mid-August will contain the price decline. The large liquidity zone in which the price is starting to enter and the large oversold conditions will push prices to perform a   pullback   on its lost 200-session average. Even in this situation, the bearish gap may not be completely covered. This would open an   important medium-term bearish trading window   with   stop loss   above the gap and a   first target   at the uptrend line ($175) and a   second target   at the floor of the long-term channel ($100).   We must be very attentive to if the value fails to overcome the 200-session average on 4-hour charts. If it performs the pull-back and fails to restructure above it, it would trigger our bearish trade.   Pablo G."

Measure trading ranges and adjust your plan for sideways action.   5. Look for bases and consolidations.   6. Zoom out and look for historical levels of support and resistance within those bases or consolidations.   7. Markets can go sideways longer than traders can stay solvent.   8.

The structure ended with-in my target box but was very complex and looked incomplete. Nonetheless, we hit the target area and dropped pretty hard to say the least. Due to the volatility and the uncertainty of the count I stayed on the sidelines. Yes, I missed out on a very lucrative day. One thing I did miss out on though, were losses. This isn't a get rich quick scheme/game. Years of compounded interest can change someone's life and trying to trade every mechanism of the market just isn't the way to do it if you ask me. So, if I missed out, big deal, there will ALWAYS be more opportunities on the horizon.   That being said, when you zoom out to the bigger picture (which is king), it clearly shows we have begun our wave iii of (3) of C of 2. I expect us to drop to the 1.0 area @ $226.14 and then bounce to about the 0.786 fib @ $234.68 before dropping in wave v of 3 to the 1.382 fib @ $211.65.

This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.   e risk on the trade is on the downside, with a potential maximum loss of $995. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (10) multiplied by 100 and factoring in the cost (5).   The maximum potential gain is around $1,035.

This is a Technical Analysis on Tesla (TSLA) on the 3 Day chart.   BRUH.......I was aspecting prices to be around the FIB retracement levels i pointed out in my previous ideas (200-220 range) a little longer. Though its still possible we can retrace back down from this current area. BUT Some bullish signs exist, therefore in my opinion we are Bullish until Proven Otherwise.   Jumping in, our current move is fueled by our Major bounce from a Critical Confluence of Supports.   We have the RED ZONE   We have the Black trendline   We have the 50 SMA   We are also ABOVE the 21 EMA, which when support is Confirmed it indicated UPTRENDS. As long as we respect the 21 EMA and stay above it.   Volume is picking up as well. WHich is also indicative of the current move. To break ABOVE resistance lines, we need to continue to see VOLUME increase.   MACD is also showing signs of waning Bearish Momentum, with Light Red histobar prints and flattening of the Blue line.   We need to avoid printing a Dark Red Bar. Instead see print of Green bars with a Bullish Cross.   RSI is also getting close to testing the Black moving average i have added. The way i use this is: Usually if RSI is ABOVE the Moving AVerage, it signifies UPtrends.   But do note: This current candle closes on the 8th of September.   And note that we are hitting some Major Resistance Area. There is always a risk of sell off. BUt as long as we continue the current trends in volume, stay above the moving averages, and maintain patterns in indicators Uptrend will continue.   __________________________________________________________________________________   Thank you for taking the time to read my analysis.

Until then I think price has shown support at 1.34 mark and trades sideways before rushing upwards to the 2.24 target and then we can explore additional action. In the event we break 1.34 to 1.27 and go downside then the 76-78 cents may become  a reality. However due to the major harmonic to the far left- it is a bullish formation which is why I tend to think this also support bullish movement over time.

2023-10-19 12:06:44,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AMZN/2OOwGnNZ-Amazon-showing-signs-of-weakness-ahead-of-Q3-earnings/,"Amazon report their latest earnings next week, with markets looking for fresh insights into US consumption in the face of elevated interest rates. Three months ago, the tech giant managed to blast through estimates, driving earnings per shares into the highest level in six-quarters. That raises question marks over the ability to maintain the upward trajectory as US consumers deal with a sharp increase to the cost of living. Thus far, retail sales data has highlighted continued strength on the spending-front, with rising wages helping to alleviate the pressure for now.   The Amazon web services cloud segment remains a key driver of growth, although the second quarter saw growth slow somewhat to 12% (vs 16% in Q1). There is a hope that AI investment will ultimately benefit the AWS service, although that hasnt come to fruition quite yet. Advertising also provides a key element to watch, with a 22% gain in the second quarter highlighting the growing influence of this segment.   There is a hope that the company will continue to gain ground as spending habits largely overlook any negative impact from higher rates. The impact of inflation has been to increase the value of goods being sold, and Amazon should benefit from that as long as clients do not limit the number of items they purchase in response. With EPS expected to come in around $0.58 (vs $0.65) for the quarter, markets are looking for consolidation of the Q2 performance rather than any blockbuster figure. That may provide the basis for outperformance should conditions allow.   From a technical perspective, the break below $130.96 and trendline support brings an end to the bullish trend that has played out over the course of 2023 thus far. This feeds into the wider bearish pattern played out through 2021 and 2021, with a break up through $146 required to bring a wider bullish picture into play. While price rallied back into that key level in mid-September, we have been showing signs of weakness ever since. As we head into the Amazon earnings report, price has completed an intraday double top formation that signals the potential for another period of weakness. However, next week should help us determine whether this is a short mterm pullback before we rally, or the beginning of another period of weakness as highlighted by the weekly chart."

The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 33.94%.   For the most recent quarter, DexCom was expected to post earnings of $0.22 per share, but it reported $0.34 per share instead, representing a surprise of 54.55%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.15 per share, while it actually produced $0.17 per share, a surprise of 13.33%.   With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for DexCom. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.   Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.   The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.   DexCom currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.39%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 26, 2023."

The streaming giant reported earnings per share of $3.73 on revenue of $8.54 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $3.49 and revenue of $8.54 billion. The third quarter results beat Netflixs previous guidance.   The company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, well above expectations for just over 6 million.   The last six months have been challenging for our industry given the combined writers and actors strikes in the US, Netflix said in a shareholder letter, noting that while the writers strike has ended, it continues to talk to the actors unions. Were committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible so everyone can return to work making movies and TV shows that audiences will love.   For the fourth quarter, Netflix sees earnings per share of $2.15 and revenue of about $8.69 billion. The revenue growth is expected to be around 10.7%, after growing 7.8% in the third quarter.

KeyBanc analysts upgraded shares to Overweight with a $510 per share price target.   ""In my my own view, Netflix is entering 2024 a cleaner story as: 1) paid sharing appears to have changed Netflix's ability to reach the next ~250M subs; 2) operating profit and FCF are steadily ramping; and 3) buybacks should support a 25%+ EPS growth profile,"" they said in an upgrade note.   JPMorgan analysts hiked the price target to $480 per share on the Overweight-rated stock.   ""Were encouraged that NFLX is executing on Paid Sharing by converting borrower households, contributing to revenue acceleration to +12% FXN in 4Q, & we believe the forecast for similar net adds to 3Q +/- a few million should skew to the upside given more favorable seasonality in 4Q & a strong content slate,"" the analysts wrote."

From a sector perspective, energy names are expected to report the biggest drop in annual earnings (-37%). However, the quarterly picture looks to provide a more positive shift according to ExxonMobil estimates, with earnings per share expected to reverse upwards after four consecutive declines. The obvious driver of revenues will be the value of underlying commodities, with the Brent global benchmark rising from $72 per barrel to $97 over the three-month period.   According to an October disclosure from ExxonMobil, the company expects profits to receive a healthy boost from higher oil, gas and fuel prices. That has lifted the outlook for earnings and revenues, with operating profits expected between $8.3 billion and $11.4 billion. That would represent a rise from the second quarter, but below the figure a year ago.   The recent purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources highlights the consolidation seen in US shale, with ExxonMobil now the biggest player. Despite speculation that Joe Bidens policies could lead to the demise of US oil, we have seen record output this year. With this purchase, they have hugely strengthened their footprint in the largest oil producing region in the US (Permian Basin). This signals to investors that they play to continue their focus on fossil fuels as competitors such as Shell transition towards a green strategy.   From a charting perspective, the recent intraday double bottom looks to bring a bullish theme heading into   XOM   earnings. That pattern took place above the 76.4% Fibonacci support level, with the break up through the $112 neckline bringing a more bullish picture into play.   From a wider perspective, the pattern of higher lows does look likely to persist, with a break below the $100 mark required to bring an end to that trend. The weekly chart highlights the uptrend very well, with a move up towards the $120 looking a distinct possibility as a result."

That is, the actual numbers turned out to be worse than forecasts. But the main negative can be considered the statements of Elon Musk, according to which:    investors' expectations from Cybertruck should be moderated; it may take from a year to 18 months for a positive effect from this product. Although the company already has about 1 million applications, the company will be able to start producing about a quarter of a million cars per year approximately in 2025;    the company is currently pausing the construction of a plant in Mexico;    the policy of high interest rates has a great impact on the activities of both the company and the global economy.   In response to the report, TSLA's share price declined. In the premarket on the morning of October 19, the share price is slightly above USD 231, although at the beginning of the week trading was above USD 255, and yesterday the closing price was above USD 242.   At the same time, it can be observed that the breakdown of the lower boundary of the ascending channel is becoming more and more obvious. The bullish trend (shown in blue) for 2023 did not hold. There were two bounce attempts (shown by arrows), but the second one demonstrated worse dynamics (the dead cat bounce pattern).

The reason is a strong report:    earnings per share = USD 3.73, expected = USD 3.49;    revenue = USD 8.54 billion, a year ago = USD 7.9 billion.    the main surprise is that the number of subscribers grew by an impressive 8.76 million in the third quarter (about 6 million were expected). The number of subscribers worldwide is approaching 250 million.   Given the increase in demand for its service, Netflix has decided to raise the price of its basic plan in the US to USD 11.99 per month from USD 9.99, and raise the price of its premium subscription to USD 22.99 per month from USD 19.99. This could attract more earnings per share in the future, which is what has helped NFLX's price soar.   From the technical analysis point of view:    NFLX price returns to the ascending channel that was in effect in 2023 and seems to be becoming relevant again. The false breakout pattern could become a support zone in the future.    NFLX price exceeded USD 370 per share.   Since early September, NFLX has been a laggard in the NASDAQ index, but after the report it may become one of the leaders. ""While we have much work to do to build out this business, we're making good progress and laying the foundation for what we believe should be a multibillion-dollar revenue stream over time,"" Netflix executives wrote in a letter to shareholders.   Resistance to a powerful bullish impulse may come from:    psychological level of USD 400;    level at USD 412  during the summer, the level provided support. But it was broken on September 13-14, and with a bearish gap, which could slow down the rally if the price of NFLX reaches this level. Also note that here is the Fibo resistance level of 50% of the decline AB.   According to TipRanks, analysts have a target price of USD 454 for NFLX, but given its recent performance, the forecast could be raised.

As you may already be aware, Tesla has experienced a noticeable drop in both its volume and margins in recent times. This decline has raised questions regarding the company's ability to sustain its profitability and meet investor expectations. While Tesla has been a frontrunner in the electric vehicle market, this recent downturn has given rise to uncertainties about the company's financial stability.   In light of these concerns, it is crucial to evaluate the potential impact of Tesla's upcoming product, the Cybertruck. With its futuristic design and promising features, the Cybertruck has garnered significant attention and anticipation from both enthusiasts and investors alike. Tesla has positioned this groundbreaking vehicle as a potential game-changer, capable of revolutionizing the pickup truck market.   Given the current circumstances, it is plausible to consider whether the Cybertruck can compensate for the losses incurred by Tesla's declining volume and margins. The success of this highly-anticipated product could potentially help restore investor confidence and provide a much-needed boost to the company's financial performance.   However, it is important to approach this situation with caution. While the Cybertruck holds significant potential, it is vital to remain objective and critically analyze the possible outcomes. As a result, I would like to encourage you to consider a temporary short position on Tesla (TSLA). By doing so, we can potentially capitalize on the current market sentiment and potential risks associated with Tesla's performance.   Please note that shorting TSLA should only be undertaken after conducting thorough research and analysis, as it carries its own inherent risks. It is essential to consult with your financial advisor or conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.   As fellow traders, it is our responsibility to stay informed, remain vigilant, and adapt our strategies accordingly.

2023-10-19 03:49:16,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TBT/n04IomZb-TBT-Double-Top/,"TBT   Double Top, A ""double top"" is a popular term used in technical analysis to describe a chart pattern that suggests a potential bearish reversal of an uptrend. Here's a breakdown of the double top pattern:   1. **Formation**: The double top pattern forms after a strong upward move or trend. It consists of two consecutive peaks that are roughly equal, with a moderate trough in-between, which is called the ""neckline"".   2. **First Peak**: The first top is formed when the upward trend reaches a resistance level and sees a reversal, leading to a price decline.   3. **Trough**: After the first peak, the price undergoes a correction, which leads to the formation of the trough. This decline is a sign of short-term profit-taking but isn't strong enough to signal a trend reversal yet.   4. **Second Peak**: Following the trough, the price will attempt to rally again, moving back towards the level of the first peak. However, it will once again meet resistance and fail to break through, leading to the formation of the second peak.   5. **Breakdown**: After the formation of the second top, if the price breaks below the neckline or the lowest point of the trough, it's a confirmation of the double top pattern and signals a trend reversal. The expected downward move can be approximately the same vertical distance as that between the peaks and the neckline.   6. **Volume**: Typically, volume tends to be higher on the left peak than on the right one. A noticeable increase in volume on the breakdown through the neckline can serve as additional confirmation.   7. **Significance**: The double top pattern is considered a powerful signal, especially when spotted on longer timeframes like daily, weekly, or monthly charts. However, as with all technical analysis patterns, it's essential to use additional indicators and methods to confirm a potential trade.   Remember, while the double top can be a reliable indicator of a trend reversal, no single method is foolproof, and it's essential always to use risk management techniques."

But today there,   was hidden powerful buying pressure, you can see it hitting resistance around 10AM, 11:30, and 2PM and then falling to new lows. On every drop, there is always buyers entering at support points and eventually the bears run out of steam and the market has no place to go but up:   firstly because everyone that's thinking of selling has already done so, secondly because price action has gotten oversold, and thirdly because there is no more downside, it creates a short squeeze resulting in an artificial but technical swell of buyers almost desperate to buy at any price.   We have hit the VWAP, we have consolidated after a small sudden dead cat .... well not really a dead cat bounce as we're still higher than previous lows but we've touched the bottom of BB on the 1hr and we should see a fast and furious attempt at a reversal soon.   Will it last? No clue, seasonality says yes, but earnings have been less than cooperative thus far.

We should see a bullish push within the next 5-6 days and heading into November. If bearish, I doubt we'll see $417 until December.   ChatGPT, reword my wall of text so that it makes sense."

Now we have to get used to these fast moves.   In 15 Minutes, chart we have multiple tops at 437- 438 levels.   In fact, more than 8 in last 7 trading days.   Yesterday once 434 break we gat 4$ move as the moving averages 50,100 and 200 were converging.   Today for the fall 436.12 to 431.09 we have 433 levels important.   This is also the converging points for above 3 moving averages.   Also if you take the last rise in daily from 420.18 to 438.14 we have 61.8% retracement around 427 levels.   That must hold today.   And in daily if you consider the fall 451.08 to 420 levels it retraced nearly to 61.8% around 439 levels. So as of now   SPY   bullish only above 440-442 levels in larger time frame.   One thing the market teaches us clearly. Do not change your rules or setup. Follow it consistently.   I have posted many days. As no trade days for me.   Post analysis is always easy.

The completion of the E leg of the triangle suggests that the consolidation phase is ending, and we may be poised for a bullish breakout.   My projection for Tesla's stock price is in the range of $318 to $335. This range is based on the anticipated upward movement of the 5th wave.   However, it's important to keep in mind that Elliott Wave Theory is a complex method of analysis, and its success relies on accurate wave counts and interpretations. Additionally, the stock market is subject to various factors that can influence price movements, so it's essential to stay informed about current market conditions and news that may impact Tesla's stock.

2023-10-19 01:09:08,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/GXC/NS9buiTF-180-degrees-turnaround-for-China-Stock/,"Read these articles   here   ,   here   and   here   It is fairly difficult to predict if the price of 60.55 on 7 Nov 2022 was the bottom for GXC ETF. If option 1 happens weeks/months later, then on hindsight we can said so. However, there lies another option (which imo is more likely) and that is more sideway movements first.   Can it come down to the support level at 70.30 and below ? Of course , though I think at this juncture is less likely. WHY ? Coz from these articles, we can see how the government of China is moving its gear to spearhead the confidence of its people to spend more, be it on EV or household appliances. Inbound tourism is picking up especially after few years of lockdown in Covid and this can be a good catalyst.   Digital economy remains a major industry for China, for now and the future so I am still banging on the tech sectors to be the first to rally (Alibaba recent share price is a good testament).   The elephant in the room is still the property sector and though no specific measures have been announced, I believe it is in the pipeline and the government will release it to boost the confidence of its people.   Option 1 is optimistic , riding on the recent news and believing people are buying into it and pumping money inside or hedge funds caught wind of more insider news and start accumulating.   Option 2 is cautiously optimistic but giving time to the market to respond. People need time and there will always be early adopters and late laggards coming into the market. Also, there are people who had lost lots of money in the stock market in the last 2 years and may take more time to heal and make a comeback. Lastly, there are options for these investors as well. Take a look at the US and other Asian markets that are giving much better returns. Why would they want to park money in their homeground when it remains uncertain and bleak ?   What will I do ? Slowly accumulate this ETF , more weightage on tech sectors (3067) and selective companies. The risk/reward ratio is pretty good from a longer term perspective as the fall of 60+ % is damaging enough and quite unlikely to exacerbate further. Thus, the upside remains two to three fold compared to the downside. Of course, this is my conjecture and nothing is certain until it happens. So, take it with a pinch of salt and DYODD."

2023-10-19 00:33:28,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/CHIR/6h6l9AL2-Chinese-Real-Estate-Investment/,"Hello friends.   I am making a huge investment into Chinese real estate equities with half my networth. My plan is to hold this for at very least a year, and realize a long term gain. I am expecting to make a 100% gain on this investment within 1-2 years. That's my base case, anyway. Things could go differently of course. Since it's an investment, I don't have plans to sell out if prices drop, unless there is something that changes more fundamentally with this market.   I am going to make a bullet point list here of my best arguments for being long Chinese real estate and some screen shots to back each part up.   Extreme stimulus from the PBOC is being pushed into markets, with Chinese money supply up 10% this year. Cuts on stamp duty taxes, explicit market-supportive statements from high officials, cuts in interest rates, and cuts in bank reserve rates all support the idea that China is easing hard and wants to push markets up.   https://prnt.sc/3nQymVM96zKU   Record panic not seen in over a decade was witnessed at the start of last September, with around 10% of ALL western finance articles being bearish on China, and every other instance of similar panic has led to great returns in the medium to long term   https://prnt.sc/7DpM9P_VJNUy   Chinese real estate equities are at the lowest valuations in history, with P/B ratios floating around 0.5 and P/E ratios floating around 5   https://prnt.sc/YFkDKnTaEQps   The Chinese housing crisis is imaginary and essentially doesn't exist, as new home prices in China are only down 0.1% this year, despite the massive amount of panic in equity markets. China sets it's own prices, and the CCP has set floors which forbid prices from actually dropping, making a crash not supported and desired by Xi   IMPOSSIBLE   within this market.   https://prnt.sc/lZPBIXSQNDkT   Almost all of the Chinese real estate companies that are inside the top holdings of the CHIR fund have remained consistently profitable and with strong balance sheets through this ""crisis"", with the single exception of Country Garden, which is likely to go bust for reasons that seem to pertain to poor management of the company, rather than the industry at large.   https://prnt.sc/pUfLFyceNtQW   The Ghost Cities that the media is obsessed with aren't as they appear to the western eyes. They are actually cities that largely WILL be populated, just in a much longer timeframe than most would ""like"". It can take a decade to fill these cities up, but they do not sit empty forever. Take for example the Zhengdong New Area which was deemed as a ""ghost city"" in a 2013 news report by 60 Minutes, which described the area as having, ""new towers with no residents, desolate condos, and vacant subdivisions uninhabited for miles and miles and miles"". Years later, Bloomberg in 2021, had described the area as ""bustling with life"", and noted that the district's economy has grown at an annual rate of 25% from 2013 to 2018, and the population has grown 27.5% from 2019 to 2020. ""Ghost Cities"" are a media sensation invented out of thin air, and they are not a new thing. The west has been deeply confused about China's real estate market for a long, long time.   That's the rundown. This is the single best opportunity I've seen in the past 2 years that I have been beating the markets, and I am 90% confident that I am right here in the long run of 1-2 years although I could totally see equity prices dropping a bit more over the next few months. The main risk is purely that China could invade Taiwan, and get obliterated by sanctions. The odds of that are currently only 5% during 2023-2024, per Metacalculus. This is something to track closely as it evolves.   https://prnt.sc/9be83MB_mJsT   The bottom line is that Xi is 70 years old without a lot of time left to live. He will kick the can down the road on the Chinese real estate bubble, and let someone else in the far future deal with the problem. If he does NOT kick the can down the road, he will be beheaded in a revolution of his people, of whom 90% own homes and have a strong vested interest in a continuation of the housing bubble. The solution to every economic problem is to print more money, and thats what he's doing."

2023-10-18 21:21:18,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/HD/AOTGyCyN-ChartPattern-Alert-Channel/,"A ""channel,"" in the context of trading and technical analysis, is a chart pattern that forms when the prices of a financial asset move between two parallel lines, creating a kind of corridor or channel. There are two main types of channels: an ascending channel and a descending channel.   Ascending Channel: This channel forms when prices have an overall upward trend, but this trend is contained within two upward-sloping parallel lines. The lower level is the support, where prices often find buyers, while the upper level is the resistance, where sellers may come into play. Traders often view the ascending channel as a sign of the continuation of the existing uptrend.   Descending Channel: On the other hand, the descending channel forms when prices have a downward trend, but this trend is bounded by two downward-sloping parallel lines. The upper level is the resistance, where prices tend to retreat, while the lower level is the support, where minor bounces may occur. Traders typically interpret the descending channel as a sign of the continuation of the downtrend.   Channel analysis is an important tool for traders as it can help identify entry and exit points, as well as set profit targets and stop-loss levels. However, it's crucial to note that channels are not foolproof, and prices can break beyond the channel lines, signaling a change in trend.   In summary, a ""channel"" is a chart formation that depicts the direction and strength of a price trend in a financial asset. It's a useful tool for traders looking to make informed decisions about their market trades."

The Rising Wedge is a bearish chart pattern characterized by two converging trendlines, with the lower trendline sloping upward more than the upper trendline. It typically signals a potential bearish reversal, with the price likely to break downward after the wedge pattern.    How to Identify:   Draw a trendline connecting at least two lower highs (upper trendline).   Draw another trendline connecting at least two lower lows (lower trendline).    What it Signals: The Rising Wedge suggests a potential bearish reversal, with sellers prevailing at lower highs within the wedge. It often forms during uptrends and can precede a significant price move to the downside.    Trade Strategy:   Consider short-selling or setting stop-loss levels if the price breaks below the lower trendline of the Rising Wedge.   Set profit targets based on the pattern's height subtracted from the breakdown point.   Implement a stop-loss to manage risk in case of a false breakdown.

2023-10-18 21:07:52,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/SPY/SFE6dxXs-SPY-3-Month-Outlook/,"So, I usually do this in a video. I tried. I failed. Microphone problems. Etc. etc. etc.   So I am just writing it out, because had I shared it when I originally intended, it probably would have been more helpful, since we bounced off of a key level recently.   Above is the 3 month high/low range, superimposed with the 6 month low range/thresholds.   You can see that we have removed target #1 for the 6 month low (420), which is very close to target #1 on the 3 month low (415).   The interesting part about this, which I have shared in my other idea, is that the 6 month bear threshold aligns with the 3 month bull threshold at around 431. This means that, 431 should be a really key area of resistance. Failing to break over that should lead us to those lower red boxes in the 404 to 399 range.   One little interesting tidbit though is there is a high prob target at 429:   Just right below the bull threshold on the 3 month and bear threshold on the 6 month. I am fine with this, because it doesn't require a break of the bull/bear condition to be hit. But what it tells us is there is a high chance we see a move back up to that 429 / 430 range.   And what it also tells us is that we may not see my 419 this week during market hours. We managed to wick down there premarket but we quickly reclaimed the bear threshold on the 3 month, which has been acting as pretty strong support.   Based on the setup, the move should theoretically be a move to 429 / 430 from here, since we technically lost and reclaimed the threshold in pre-market.   If we break out of the bull threshold/back over the bear threshold on the 6 month, the immediate target would be for a move back to the bull threshold on the 6 month at 451 (I would be pretty ticked if this happened though, honestly).   For the 3/6 month, I classify a break and hold as 3, full day closes above the threshold.   Either way, this will serve as our EOY roadmap. Which will forever be marked by the almighty pumpkins.   So if you come back to reference this in December, you will be reminded that Halloween is the best :P.   Those are my thoughts, safe trades everyone!"

This classic reversal formation suggests that the ETF may have reached or is nearing a bottom and could experience an upward momentum in the near future.   In this setup, the 'head' represents the lowest point of the pattern and is flanked by two higher 'shoulders,' signaling a possible exhaustion of the prevailing bearish trend. The 'neckline' is the resistance level that the asset needs to break through convincingly for the pattern to be confirmed. A decisive breakout above this resistance could trigger a significant upward price movement, substantiating the bullish outlook.   Investors should, however, exercise caution and consider various risk factors, including market volatility, liquidity conditions, and external macroeconomic variables. While the inverse head and shoulders pattern is generally considered a reliable indicator of a trend reversal, it is essential to corroborate this technical observation with other analytical tools and data points.   Given the current market conditions and ongoing pressures in other asset classes such as fixed income, a close monitoring of   SPY   's performance relative to the neckline resistance is warranted. Successful navigation of these complex market dynamics will require a multifaceted investment strategy that takes into account both technical and fundamental analyses."

There has been accumulation going on since the lows of 2022.   Selling Short is problematic due to the support levels not far down from the current price and the risk of a hidden Dark Pool Buy Zone starting at the highs of the U-shaped bottom formation.

2023-10-18 18:22:27,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NVDA/Qx3wc31m-NVDA-Stock-Chart-work/,"NVIDIA has historically been considered a strong performer in the technology sector, driven by its dominance in the GPU market, expansion into AI and data center solutions, and its strategic acquisitions. Its stock price may be influenced by factors such as the release of new products, innovations in AI and data center technology, and broader market trends.   If you're considering investing in NVIDIA or any other company, it's essential to conduct thorough research, consider your risk tolerance, and possibly consult with a financial advisor. Additionally, it's wise to diversify your investments to spread risk.   Using geometry as a heuristic for setting trend lines in stock market analysis involves applying geometric shapes and patterns to identify potential support and resistance levels on a stock chart. This can provide traders and investors with visual cues about potential price movements.   Here are some common geometric patterns and techniques used in this context:   Trendlines: These are straight lines drawn on a chart to connect two or more price points. A trendline can be used to identify the direction of a trend - upward (bullish) or downward (bearish). When a stock's price approaches a trendline, it can act as either support (if below the price) or resistance (if above the price).   Channels: Channels are formed by drawing parallel lines above and below a trendline. This creates a channel in which the stock's price tends to move. The upper line serves as resistance, and the lower line serves as support. Channels can help traders identify potential entry and exit points.   Triangles: There are different types of triangles, including ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. These patterns are formed by converging trendlines. They can provide insights into potential breakouts or breakdowns in price.   Fibonacci Retracement: While not a geometric shape in the traditional sense, Fibonacci retracement levels are based on a series of ratios derived from the Fibonacci sequence. These levels can be used to identify potential support and resistance levels based on natural market movements.   Rectangles: Rectangles occur when the price of a stock moves within a horizontal range for an extended period. The upper line of the rectangle serves as resistance, and the lower line serves as support. Traders look for potential breakouts or breakdowns from these levels.   Head and Shoulders: This is a pattern that resembles a head with two shoulders. It is used to identify potential trend reversals. The head is the highest point, and the shoulders are two lower peaks. A break below the neckline is considered a bearish signal.   Cup and Handle: This pattern looks like the shape of a tea cup with a handle. It is a bullish continuation pattern and is used to identify potential buying opportunities.   When applying these geometric heuristics to analyze a stock chart, it's important to keep in mind that no method is foolproof. They should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, and risk management strategies should always be in place.   Additionally, market conditions can change, and patterns that have historically been reliable may not always hold true. Therefore, it's crucial to stay updated with the latest information and adjust strategies accordingly."

So according to data above shared it halted it's reversal journey near to 372 levels where price took a strong resistance (marked on chart) and came down a bit near to 290 levels, And after when it broken that that 372 levels it gives a parabolic move in ascending channel marked on chart too and that breakout took price to 485 levels in the July 2023. And after break of that ascending channel support line price tried to go again in that channel but failed and in this process it made a double top on provided chart and after the break of neckline mentioned on chart it reached to near that 372 levels again now.   So my point is this that price currently it is trading near to 372 levels which can act as a support now prior it was resistance as mentioned in description above. If break and close below can check lower support target below, and if bounce we can see it can test mentioned neckline area again or above after the break of neckline which surely will act as resisatnce for now.   Will try to give proper updates if i will go for any executions in it.   Price can take 200 Ema support also   This is not and trade or investment advice. This idea is meant for learning only.

MARA, which we are covering today is the is the 2nd largest public bitcoin mining company in the world. Soon I will cover RIOT which is the LARGEST. We save the best till last.   THIS TRADE:   18:1 trade with 592% potential upside and only -32% downside (the stop could be lowered if you have a higher risk tolerance).   Bullish Developments on the chart:   - Price above the POC means strong underside support   Point of Control (POC) is the price level at which   the greatest number of contracts have been traded   within a volume profile.   - Above 200 day SMA means further strong underside support along side POC line. The 200 day   SMA has not turned upwards yet and I would be much happier is this would materialize.   - We are potentially breaking out of the parallel channel right now. We need confirmation of this. I would prefer the 200 SMA to turn up and for price to bounce off it at some point. This would provide additional comfort.   FINALLY, I think this could be also fall into the long term trade category. The RR is exceptional. The stop can be tight or a little looser. For me, im playing the long term game with BTC and will be holding positions long term in Miners too. If the trade plays out ill be skimming the position for sure but ill be leaving positions run and will update as we follow.   Play it safe guys. Positions that mean nothing to you. Remove and/or manage emotions with position size.   Some Fundamentals to help MARA stick in the mind   - 2nd largest public bitcoin miner   - MARA have 105,200 mining rigs deployed (CIPHER by comparison have 70,000 rigs and RIOT have 84,000+. My understanding is RIOT have the newer 2,000 Antminer S19j Pro miners and 3,000 S19 Pro rigs which arguably perform better) Ill make a table of these differences at some point   - Interestingly the market cap of MARA is $1.98bln just behind RIOT at $2.00bln. CIPR is $0.70bln   - MARA mined 825 bitcoin in the month of March 2023 (Cipher by comparison mined 493 in May and RIOT mining an ATH of 740 BTC in Jan 2023). Again ill do a bit of digging here to see can we get updated figures.   Thats all folks, stay posted for RIOT coming next and some comparison work on T--itter   PUKA"

In terms of managing this trade the chart really shows you everything. This is a long term trade with a good risk return ratio.

Stop loss is outlined on the chart and should be honored. We can always re-enter the trade at a later date having reviewed the situation. Setting a stop under the 200 day SMA could be used as a trailing type of stop also.

It appears things are just heating up.   Fabulous Quote from the CEO from back in November 2022 which gives you an idea of the location and their unique offering   We are delighted to announce that our Odessa data center has begun bitcoin mining operations just 10 months after we broke ground at the site. The start of mining at Odessa represents a critical step in Ciphers journey to become a market leader in the U.S. bitcoin mining industry. Since going public in 2021, we have built four data centers in Texas and are now one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin, said Tyler Page, CEO. Because of our long-term, fixed price power contract at Odessa, we also have an advantage that few other bitcoin miners have -- the flexibility to mine bitcoin or resell our power to the market, which can help mitigate the effects of falling bitcoin prices."

The company's fundamentals are robust, with impressive profit margins and returns. The stock's recent performance indicates some volatility, but the long-term trend has been positive. The company's dividend yield of 3.13% is also attractive for income-seeking investors.   However, the stock's recent decline in YTD return and its position below the 200-day moving average might raise concerns for some investors. The high beta indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market, which could lead to larger price swings.

The recent earnings show a positive surprise, indicating that the company performed better than analysts' expectations.   However, the stock's performance over the past year and YTD has been negative, which might be a concern for potential investors. The Sharpe ratio is also in the negative territory, indicating that the risk-adjusted performance hasn't been great.

There are three potential triangle variations that can develop as price action carves out a holding pattern, namely ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles.   Ascending triangle   :   This pattern is formed when the upper trendline is horizontal and the lower trendline slopes up.

According to the bank's CFO, Alastair Borthwick, this loss can be attributed to the declining value of US government bonds in the bank's portfolio, as a result of rising interest rates. The loss is anticipated to recover once the government fulfils its obligations, leading to an expected increase in Bank of America's accounting earnings.   Today, we propose to focus on the Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stock chart.   On the D1 timeframe, support has formed at 25.84, with resistance at 27.67. There is a significant probability of a breakthrough at the resistance level.   On the H1 timeframe, the short-term target for the price increase is around 30.65; while in the medium term, it could reach 37.09.

Now after a bounce, momentum bears may look for a retest of recent lows.   The first pattern on todays chart is the selloff that began on September 27 after its NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) limited partnership cut its long-term growth forecast. The drop represented a break of support around $67 that had been in place since late 2020.   NEE started bouncing on October 6, but is now stalling below a 50 percent retracement of the bearish thrust. That could suggest continuation to the downside is coming.   Third, consider the tight price action around $54 since last Friday. That may create the potential for prices to start moving again if the utility stock breaks the range.

Those assets include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. What Ive done here is created an index chart that enables an Elliott Wave count of all 7 assets combined. The all time high was printed in November 2021, along with the rest of the major stock indexes. Since then, these magnificent 7 have carved out a 5 wave expanding diagonal decline, followed by a 3 wave corrective zigzag that ended in July 2023. This is an incredible 1-2 series to begin a massive decline to an all time low below $170 for an index currently valued around $1800. But lets not put the cart before the horse and instead look at whats right in front of us. Since the wave 2 high in July, this house of cards has begun to tumble, printing a smaller degree 1-2 decline that is only the beginning of a much bigger fall described in this post."

Since we had stochastic black bar on top it will be buy on retrace as expected.   But as explained i did not enter ant trade yesterday.   Consider the fall 451.08 to 420.18.   The rise 432.46 to 438.14   And the last fall 438.14 to 434.23   The first fall has 440 levels as 61.8% retracement.   The second rise retraced to 61.8% yesterday and is read for a move.   The third fall has 61.8% around436-437 levels.   We have stochastics black bar on top, curled upwards without any black bar at bottom. Now around 437 levels a buy should trigger for 440-442 as target.   The moving averages have converged in lower 3- and 5-minute time frames.   So today or tomorrow I expect a move towards 440-442 levels if holding 434 levels.   On downside since 200 averages s around 433.7, sloping upwards I feel the fall will be limited to that number.   Hence good R:R setup coming.   In the event we have a movement between 434-438 today then tomorrow is the day to make some $$.   So, i will wait for first 15 minutes for a setup today."

However, the recent underperformance (negative YTD return) and the volatility might be a concern, which introduces some caution, hence the neutral stance.

The company's earnings have been positive, with recent quarters showing a positive surprise in EPS compared to estimates. The company's fundamentals, such as the operating margin and profit margin, are robust. The PE ratio is at a moderate level, indicating that the stock might be reasonably priced. The company has a strong dividend history, which is a positive sign for income-focused investors.   However, the YTD return is negative, indicating some recent underperformance. The volatility is also relatively high, which might be a concern for risk-averse investors.   In conclusion, Lockheed Martin appears to be a fundamentally strong company with consistent growth and a good dividend history. However, potential investors should be cautious about the recent underperformance and consider the company's volatility before making an investment decision.

But what do my eyes see that makes me wake up at night?   Price broke out of this Flag/bounce and within one single bar it was able to reach the Center line.

2023-10-18 12:33:52,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/NVDA/PbOts9ji-Foxconn-and-Nvidia-are-building-AI-factories/,"Nvidia and Foxconn are working together to build so-called ""AI factories,"" a new class of data centers that promise to provide supercomputing powers to accelerate the development of self-driving cars, autonomous machines and industrial robots.   Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang and Foxconn chairman and CEO Young Liu announced the collaboration at Hon Hai Tech Day in Taiwan on Tuesday. The AI factory is based off an Nvidia GPU computing infrastructure that will be built to process, refine and transform vast amounts of data into valuable AI models and information.   ""We're building this entire end-to-end system where on the one hand, you're building this advanced EV car...with an AI brain inside that allows it to interact with drivers and interact with passengers, as well as autonomously drive, complemented by an AI factory that develops a software for this car,"" said Huang onstage at the event. ""This car will go through life experience and collect more data. The data will go to the AI factory, where the AI factory will improve the software and update the entire AI fleet.""   The AI factory tie-up builds off a partnership between Nvidia and Foxconn announced in January to develop autonomous vehicle platforms. That agreement involved Foxconn becoming a primary supplier of electronic control units (ECUs) for automakers, which will be built with Nvidia's Drive Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC), a supercomputing AI platform that supports autonomous driving functions. On Tuesday, Foxconn also committed to manufacturing ECUs with Drive Thor, Nvidia's next-gen SoC, after production starts in 2025.   As part of that partnership, Foxconn -- which has been steadily unveiling off-the-shelf EV platforms for automakers to purchase -- said the vehicles it makes as a contract manufacturer will be built with Nvidia's Drive Hyperion 9 platform, which includes not only Drive Thor, but also a suite of sensors like cameras, radar, lidar and ultrasonic that are necessary for self-driving capabilities.   Foxconn is already contracted to build EVs for Fisker, even as it gets sued by its erstwhile partner Lordstown Motors. The automaker will need scale in order to make its AI factories viable, especially if it's going to compete with Tesla."

What are the price levels long investors and traders need to be cautious about?   My structural analysis of price dynamics shows that there is an important level of mid-term resistance in 590-625 that may serve as the topping area and lead to start of the correction towards important support zone 510-466.   This support zone is the main crossroad between two counts presented. If 466 level will not hold under any perspective selling pressure, then macro-bearish white count becomes operative with lows below Oct 22 to be expected.   If price manages to stay above this 510-466 level, then at least one more leg-up towards 680+ would be my main expectation.   Another important cautious sign from the volume perspective, is escalating weekly distribution candle in Sep, with yet no contra-accumulation bars.   It is still early and inappropriate to take decisively bearish stance, due to price being in supportive uptrend and not breaking any even short-term moving averages. The purpose of this analysis is to provide potential framework for important resistance area ahead for any long positions already established.   The analysis is valid until price stays below 625. Decisive move above 625 will force me to reconsider and re-do the analysis.   Important notice:   Elliot waves and fibonacci retracements are a very subjective form of analysis and I don't personally trade out of them. I use them only for the purpose of gauging structural potential of any assets, that allows me to put more confidence when low-risk trading set-up emerges.

My outlook suggests a price target of approximately $450 USD within the next month.   1. Historical Analysis with ABC Calculator:   The ABC Calculator indicator has been a reliable tool for assessing historical price movements in the SPY. After a thorough analysis, it's evident that the SPY has exhibited several bullish patterns in the past, often following periods of consolidation or minor corrections. These historical patterns suggest the potential for a bullish trend to develop.   2. Adapted Volume Indicator:   The Adapted Volume indicator has consistently signaled strength in buying activity, indicating that market participants are showing increased interest in the SPY. This growing volume aligns with bullish market sentiments, as higher volumes often accompany upward price movements.   Price Target: $450 USD within 1 Month:   Taking into account the historical analysis and the current sentiment suggested by the technical indicators, I foresee a target price of around $450 USD for the SPY within the next month. However, it's important to note that the market can be influenced by various external factors, and this projection should be used as a guideline rather than a guarantee.   Risk Factors:   It's crucial to acknowledge that all investments carry inherent risks, and the SPY is no exception. Potential risks include economic events, geopolitical developments, and unforeseen market sentiment changes that could impact the bullish outlook. Traders and investors should employ risk management strategies to protect their positions.   In conclusion, the technical analysis indicates a bullish potential for the SPY, supported by historical patterns and the Adapted Volume indicator. However, it's important to stay informed about market developments and employ proper risk management to make well-informed investment decisions.   Please note that this analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making investment decisions."

After that, it retreated lower, creating a potential setup for a double-top pattern. As a result, we are carefully watching the developments on the daily chart, with the main focus on RSI, which seems to have topped slightly below 70 points last week. In many instances, such behavior is associated with bear markets. Therefore, in the next few days, we will observe whether it will be able to break into the overbought territory; if not, it will act as a warning sign. One thing to consider, however, is that Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings next week. Within the past two years, all except for one earnings release were accompanied by a volatile price action and an opening gap the next day. Consequently, we would not be surprised to see a similar occurrence take place this time again. That brings us to the conclusion that staying on the sidelines would be the best alternative until the company releases its earnings.

2023-10-18 06:29:24,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/6j3AKB7Y-Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Predictions/,"Predicting market prices has been a considerable area of research for many decades now. From momentum to seasonal trends, this article explores five schools of thought on how prices can be predicted in financial markets.   Momentum   In trading, momentum theory posits that assets trending up or down are likely to continue in the same direction. The core idea is that market participants often react gradually to new information, causing asset prices to adjust over time rather than instantaneously. This leads to a momentum effect, which traders can exploit to anticipate future price movements.   Traders employing a momentum strategy usually focus on assets that have performed well over a specified period, expecting that they will continue to outperform. Conversely, they might steer clear of, or even short-sell, assets that have been underperforming. The efficacy of momentum strategies has been supported by numerous empirical studies, showing a consistent ability to generate above-average returns. However, it's essential to note that momentum is a trend-following strategy. The strategy may not perform well in range-bound or highly volatile markets.   Momentum trading requires real-time data and effective tools. Head over to FXOpens native TickTrader trading platform to access both within minutes.   Mean Reversion   Mean reversion operates on the principle that asset prices will revert to their historical average or ""mean"" over time. This counter-trend strategy is grounded in the belief that markets are essentially cyclical and that external influences causing prices to deviate significantly from their averages are temporary. Therefore, when a stock exhibits a substantial rise or fall, traders utilising mean reversion expect it to eventually revert to its historical norm.   For example, if a particular stock has deviated significantly from its historical average price-to-earnings ratio, a mean reversion trader might anticipate the stock to adjust back to that average in due course.   Importantly, mean reversion is more effective when applied over longer timeframes. Short-term fluctuations often occur due to market noise and do not necessarily indicate a true deviation from the mean. Various academic studies and back-tests have provided empirical support for mean reversion, although it's crucial to manage risks carefully, as significant external events can sometimes cause permanent shifts away from historical averages.   This theory is also commonly applied to commodity and currency markets.   Martingales   The concept of Martingales challenges the idea that past trends can be used to make stock market predictions. Originating in probability theory, a martingale is a sequence where the best forecast for the next value is the current one. Paul Samuelson, in 1965, argued that in an efficient market, stock prices would follow a martingale process, meaning past pricing trends have no impact on future prices.   The Martingale theory posits that the valuation doesn't depend on historical pricing or future predictions. Instead, it's a function of the stock's current price and its estimated volatility. Essentially, the market encapsulates all known information, rendering the past irrelevant for prediction.   However, a sub-class exists known as sub-martingales. In this scenario, the next number in the sequence is more likely to be higher, resembling a 'random walk with upward drift.' This notion aligns with over 80 years of stock market history where, despite many short-term reversals, the long-term trend has generally been upwards.   The Martingale theory encourages traders to focus less on past performance for predictions and more on managing the inherent risks in their volatile investments. It implies that if stock returns are essentially stochastic, tomorrows best stock price forecast is today's price adjusted for a very small expected increase.   The Search for Value   Value investing focuses on identifying undervalued stocks based on certain financial metrics in the belief that the market will eventually recognise and correct this undervaluation. Key indicators include the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Dividend Yield, and free cash flow, among others. These metrics offer insights into a company's financial health and growth prospects, helping traders identify assets that are priced lower than their intrinsic value.   This method is often long-term and requires a deep dive into a company's financials, management, and competitive standing. It stems from the principles of renowned investors like Warren Buffett, who have successfully employed value investing strategies to achieve remarkable returns.   However, value-based predictions carry their own set of risks. Market conditions can take longer than anticipated to correct undervaluations, and there's always the possibility that the market has rightly discounted the stock for issues not immediately evident in financial metrics.   Seasonal and Cyclical Patterns   Seasonal and cyclical patterns delve into the periodic behaviours observed in the financial markets. Unlike methods that focus on intrinsic value or immediate price action, this approach analyses recurring trends that happen over defined periods. These could range from quarterly earnings cycles to broader economic cycles that last several years.   Seasonal patterns might include the ""January Effect,"" where stocks generally rise in the first month of the year, or retail stocks outperforming in the lead-up to the holiday shopping season. On a larger scale, cyclical patterns often correlate with economic conditions, such as the performance of construction stocks during a housing boom.   Data-driven traders study historical charts and market behaviour during these periods to anticipate similar trends in the future. While not foolproof, the method has shown statistical relevance, providing traders with an additional tool in their predictive arsenal.   The Bottom Line   Understanding various market analysis methodsbe it momentum, mean reversion, martingales, value searching, or seasonal and cyclical patternsoffers traders diverse strategies for predicting stock prices.

This is not the first time I have pointed this out on tradingview.   In 2011 we had the Arab Spring. In 2022 we have the spread of Russian terrorism, in Syria, Ukraine, all over Africa, Azerbaijan/Armenia, Kosovo/Serbia, and now Israel.   Back in March 2021 when no one suspected inflation, I was warning that a strong dollar would be bad for emerging markets.   By April 2021 I warned again   Today we all see the reality unfold precisely as I warned would happen. Not just in VMO ETF but in nations currencies that have been blowing up all over the place. Turkey, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Venezuela, Pakistan, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ukraine, Russia, Japan, etc.. yet they don't call it a global currency crisis for some odd reason.   As we all watch the Israeli war play out, it is important to remember this is not random and unpredictable on the whole. Only the geographical locations that would be involved were unknown. Not that it would happen somewhere in the world.   Here is how it goes   Excessive Gov't borrowing leads to excessive inequality, excessive savings in the hands of the few, excessive asset speculation that flows into commodity prices that cause inflation, cause rates to rise, bonds to implode, a strong dollar, weaker emerging markets, and currency crisis which causes global social unrest.   Food price inflation is the spark that sets off uncontrollable wildfires.   Thx to tradingview no one can say I did not forecast wars were coming. The problem is no one realizes what I am saying when I am saying it. That's the nature of the beast."

I am not a big Fibonacci trader, but I do like to look at retracements and the .618% and 50% levels seem to be levels where stocks can make a turn.   I use trendlines and support / resistance areas for my trading style. In this case, the 50% retrace area lines up well with an area of resistance. I like how it seems to be respecting (somewhat) the 40 Week MA in white. I have an alert set for a cross over $31 and again over the upper downtrend line. To be clear,   CFLT   is in a confirmed downtrend based on the downward sloping channel and a series of lower highs and lower lows. So, I am looking for a trend change. All TBD.

The Buybacks started in March and have continued until recently. I showed the buyback activity on the daily chart in   this article   earlier this month.   The Support from corporate buybacks poses problems for selling short. The stock is also prone to HFT triggers with frequent gapping. The first Support level is just above the 2022 lows.   The company reported earnings this morning and gapped down at open but is holding onto the sideways range it's been in for 2 weeks so far.   However, Quarterly and Annual Reports are starting to show signs of weakness as this company struggles to reinvent.   GS   is also facing loss of revenues from IPO underwriting as the NASDAQ Private Market is undermining the high income usually generated from IPOs by underwriters.

2023-10-17 19:26:12,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/GS/ChCM3fSe-ChartPattern-Alert-Channel/,"A ""channel,"" in the context of trading and technical analysis, is a chart pattern that forms when the prices of a financial asset move between two parallel lines, creating a kind of corridor or channel. There are two main types of channels: an ascending channel and a descending channel.   Ascending Channel: This channel forms when prices have an overall upward trend, but this trend is contained within two upward-sloping parallel lines. The lower level is the support, where prices often find buyers, while the upper level is the resistance, where sellers may come into play. Traders often view the ascending channel as a sign of the continuation of the existing uptrend.   Descending Channel: On the other hand, the descending channel forms when prices have a downward trend, but this trend is bounded by two downward-sloping parallel lines. The upper level is the resistance, where prices tend to retreat, while the lower level is the support, where minor bounces may occur. Traders typically interpret the descending channel as a sign of the continuation of the downtrend.   Channel analysis is an important tool for traders as it can help identify entry and exit points, as well as set profit targets and stop-loss levels. However, it's crucial to note that channels are not foolproof, and prices can break beyond the channel lines, signaling a change in trend.   In summary, a ""channel"" is a chart formation that depicts the direction and strength of a price trend in a financial asset. It's a useful tool for traders looking to make informed decisions about their market trades."
2023-10-17 19:02:26,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AAPL/rChs9POF-Wyckoff-Analysis/,"Wyckoff analysis is a technical analysis approach that can help investors decide what stocks to buy and when to buy them. It is based on the observations of Richard Wyckoff, a stockbroker and financial analyst who lived in the early 20th century. Wyckoff observed that markets move in a cyclical pattern of four distinct phases:   1. Accumulation: This is the phase in which large investors are buying up shares at a relatively low price. The price action is typically choppy and sideways, with no clear trend.   2. Markup: This is the phase in which the price of the stock begins to rise significantly. Large investors are still buying, but now they are joined by smaller investors and traders.   3. Distribution:** This is the phase in which large investors are selling their shares at a relatively high price. The price action is typically choppy and sideways, with no clear trend.   4. Markdown: This is the phase in which the price of the stock begins to fall significantly. Large investors are still selling, and now they are joined by smaller investors and traders.   Wyckoff believed that by carefully studying the price action and volume of a stock, traders could identify the current phase of the market cycle and make informed trading decisions. For example, a trader might look for signs of accumulation in a stock that has been beaten down in price and has a low price-to-earnings ratio. If the trader sees signs of accumulation, they might buy the stock in anticipation of a markup phase.   Here are some key characteristics of each phase of the Wyckoff market cycle:   Accumulation   Price action is choppy and sideways, with no clear trend.   Volume is typically low.   Large investors are buying shares at a relatively low price.   Smaller investors and traders are generally unaware of the accumulation phase.   Markup   Price action begins to rise significantly.   Volume increases as more investors and traders become interested in the stock.   Large investors continue to buy shares, but they are now joined by smaller investors and traders.   The markup phase typically lasts for several months or even years.   Distribution   Price action becomes choppy and sideways again, with no clear trend.   Volume may remain high, but it is often lower than it was during the markup phase.   Large investors are selling their shares at a relatively high price.   Smaller investors and traders may still be buying the stock, but they are unaware that the distribution phase is underway.   Markdown   Price action begins to fall significantly.   Volume increases as more investors and traders become aware of the downtrend.   Large investors continue to sell their shares, and they are now joined by smaller investors and traders.   The markdown phase typically lasts for several weeks or even months.   Wyckoff analysis can be a valuable tool for investors who want to make more informed trading decisions. However, it is important to note that Wyckoff's analysis is not a perfect system. There is no guarantee that the market will always follow the Wyckoff pattern. Additionally, Wyckoff analysis can be complex and time-consuming to learn and apply.   If you are interested in learning more about Wyckoff analysis, there are a number of resources available online and in libraries. There are also a number of professional Wyckoff analysts who offer training and coaching services."
2023-10-17 18:52:00,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/IWM/LKLRTIYm-Despite-a-strong-week-IWM-remains-in-trading-range/,"Primary Chart: IWM / Russell 2000 Weekly Timeframe   The Russell 2000 (IWM) is often a leading indicator in US markets. It led to the downside in early November 2021 after a false breakout out of its 2021 topping-pattern's resistance around $234. SPX topped nearly two months later on January 4, 2022. While small-caps are not necessarily always the first to make a move, it is something frequently cited by commentators and analysts. This is why the Russell 2000 is important for traders and investors to follow to maintain a deeper understanding of the broader US equity markets.   Despite a very strong weekly close for IWM, its price remains in the lower half of its trading range. This trading range has contained price for the past 1.5 years, since the topping pattern's support (at the upper blue rectangle) broke down in January 2022. Unlike other major US indices like the Nasdaq 100, IWM has continued to struggle and remains well below its August 2022 and January / February 2023 highs.   Two months ago, in a recent post titled ""   Something is Rotten in the State of Markets   ,"" IWM's underperformance of SPX provided a basis for discussion as to why US equity markets may remain unhealthy despite the bullish price action YTD (see link below). A strong and long-lasting bull market should show signs of broad participation. Many breadth indicators have shown very narrow breadth. It's not a surprise, in fact, that SPX's rally and upside performance has been driven by 5 to 10 SPX names, with the other 490-495 flat, lagging, or up weakly.   Supplementary Chart A   This previous April 10 analysis displayed a hypothetical price path intended to reflect the possibility of more sideways and choppy price action in the intermediate term. The choppy price action has largely unfolded as expected (click the play / refresh arrow on the prior post from April 10, 2023). In fact, IWM's price at the time of the prior post was at $173.89, and a month later on May 8 it had closed almost at the same level around $172.72.   Now IWM appears to be breaking above the recent trading range. Major levels of resistance appear on the Primary Chart as Fibonacci levels (the .618 retracement and the .50 retracement, which is not technically a Fibonacci proportion) as well as the anchored VWAP from the November 2021 ATH.  How price responds to these levels will be important to watch in coming weeks especially after June 16, 2023 OPEXa quad witching event.   It is notable that IWM trades far below its major ATH VWAP from November 2021.  Compare how IWM's price trades relative to this VWAP (labeled on the Primary Chart above) with how SPY's price trades relative to its ATH VWAP. SPY's VWAP anchored to its ATH is shown in Supplementary chart B below.   Supplementary Chart B   Finally, a relative chart of Russell 2000 vs. S&P 500 is helpful to examine these two major US equity indices and how IWM has performed YTD relative to the SPY / SPX.  See Supplementary Chart C below.  This relative chart shows IWM still in a downtrend relative to SPY. And it still shows that IWM vs. SPY remains below major resistance. Given that IWM is a leading index at times, it will be interesting to see whether what happens to the major resistance on this relative chart that was broken in early April 2023. Will it hold?   Supplementary Chart C   In summary, the small-cap stocks in the US equity market are lagging despite putting in a strong weekly performance this week of +3.33%. The primary trend in small caps remains sideways by any measure. Will IWM play catch up to the other main US indices like S&P 500 (   SPX   ) and Nasdaq 100 (   NDX   QQQ   )?  No one knows for sure. But the liquidity problems plaguing the US economy tend to show up in the weakest names first, which usually are also the smallest names. Could IWM's underperformance be a sign of this liquidity stress?  Or will it catch up to confirm that the current rally in NDX and SPY are perfectly healthy under the hood and headed to new all-time highs?  Stay tuned.

QQQ and NQ have some serious overhead resistance that can bring down SPY.   SPY is bouncing off of its monthly thresholds, the expected move is technically a move to 441.   If you are short biased, you want to look for SPY to fall below 434.77 and hold it for a move to 432.59. Breaking 432.59 should lead us to the weekly low targets:   As of right now, I am on the sidelines of the indices. The move is actually expected based on the respecting of the monthly bull threshold, but I still feel like we could see some heavy/bearish action because of the positioning of tech.   If we are going to see some big decline in SPY, we need SPY to lose 430. Else we are just going to rinse and repeat with these bullish pushes.   If we are going to complete the move this week, we should see a move to 441.   Its really hard to say what is overly likely to happen this week because the PA is quite dramatic and erratic.

2023-10-17 15:38:26,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/KO/EFMnwbOw-Coca-Cola-The-Dividend-Dilemma-in-Changing-Times/,"Coca-Cola: The Dividend Dilemma in Changing Times   Investors are grappling with uncertainty about the long-term prospects of Coca-Cola as an investment. While this beverage giant undeniably dominates its industry and enjoys impressive profit margins, changing consumer preferences away from sugary beverages suggest that Coca-Cola's era of robust growth may be in the rearview mirror.   To gain a clearer perspective, let's delve into the key arguments in favor of and against this widely-held dividend powerhouse.   In Favor of Coca-Cola:   Coca-Cola ticks most of the boxes that investors typically consider when evaluating a core stock holding. Qualitative factors, such as its iconic brand, undeniable competitive advantages, and a long history of sustained growth, align with robust financial metrics encompassing healthy cash flow, profitability, and a consistent track record of dividend increases, making it an attractive choice.   While Coca-Cola might not be a growth stock, it has the potential to offer steady returns, even in the face of changing consumer preferences. Despite subdued demand for its traditional products, the company excels in profitability, with operating income reaching 32% of sales in the second quarter. In the first half of 2023, free cash flow hit $4 billion, on par with the prior year's record results.   These financial achievements provide Coca-Cola's management with ample resources to invest in brand support through marketing and innovation. Additionally, they bode well for shareholders, as it's highly likely that Coca-Cola will continue its streak of annual dividend increases, targeting its 61st consecutive increase in 2024.   Against Coca-Cola:   Coca-Cola's glory days from the 20th century may be fading. Soda sales in the United States peaked in 2004 and have been on a steep decline, particularly on a per-capita basis, due to health concerns that have led consumers to opt for alternative beverages. Even diet sodas have not escaped this trend, with sales in this category, a significant cash generator for the industry, declining even faster than regular soda.   Coca-Cola has tried to counter these challenges by introducing smaller packaging sizes, raising prices, and diversifying beyond its core soda business, such as through the acquisition of the Costa Coffee chain. However, these efforts have not been sufficient to position the stock as a winner.   Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has clearly outperformed Coca-Cola in terms of price appreciation and total returns. The changing landscape of consumer preferences and the ongoing decline in soda consumption present significant headwinds for the company.   Lastly, while consumer staples stocks like Coca-Cola have generally thrived in the current economic environment, given the resilience of sales in groceries and essential products, the same cannot be said for Coca-Cola. Even during this favorable context, Coca-Cola has had a less-than-impressive year. If it struggles to outperform in such a climate, it appears less likely to do so when investors regain confidence in an economic recovery and growth stocks come back into favor.   In conclusion, Coca-Cola stands at a crossroads. Its resilience and commitment to dividends are unquestionable, but it faces an evolving consumer landscape that has eroded the once-dominant position of sugary beverages. For investors, the decision on Coca-Cola hinges on their risk tolerance and investment objectives, as they weigh the allure of a stable dividend against the challenges of changing consumer preferences."

This one is basically all fundamental:   GS just reported earnings, and they took a bunch of charges, which made 3Q2023 a lot worse than 3Q2022. They did, however, still beat estimates.   It looks to me like GS is finally getting out of a lot of the headwinds they had over the past couple of years:   IPO and M&A activity has been very muted over the last several quarters, and we are finally starting to see a decent pipeline emerge.   The bank is getting ready to jettison its Apple partnership, and its whole consumer-facing Marcus franchise.   GS significantly cut exposure to commercial real estate, which looks like it will produce losses for years to come.   The WFH controversy that has caused a lot of dissatisfaction within the ranks seems to have died down.   Most importantly, today's earnings seem to be met with relief by investors that it wasn't as bad as feared. From a valuation perspective banks have been cheap for a long time, and continue to look cheap to me. And IV is very low by historical comparison.

The global entertainment landscape has undergone a transformative shift with the rise of streaming platforms, effectively eclipsing traditional media such as television.   Leading this digital revolution is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), providing audiences access to an extensive library of movies and series for a modest subscription fee.   As we approach Wednesday, expectations are running high for the release of Netflix's third-quarter results, a key event in light of the platform's recent policy shift regarding password sharing.   Introduced in May of this year, this change aimed to curb the unauthorized sharing of accounts and appears to be having the desired effect, as user numbers continue to grow  a change that is poised to manifest itself in the forthcoming third-quarter figures.   Yet, intriguingly, despite Netflix's robust user growth, its stock has been navigating a broad correction phase, prompting speculation that the conclusion of this adjustment may yield results exceeding current forecasts.   In the lead-up to the results, all eyes are on Netflix's projected earnings per share, which currently stand at an estimated $3.48, alongside revenues totaling $8.53 billion.   Notably, the forecast has experienced a remarkable 24 upward revisions, with only 3 instances of downward revision, indicating a high level of market anticipation."

Concerns/Risks:   o	Schwab is not a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB)   o	The 200 week SMA has been lost   o	Rumours of Bankruptcy   Company Summary   o	Charles Schwab is the 17th largest bank in the world with a market cap of $94.4 billion.   o	Charles Schwab is primarily a wealth management and investment bank which stands out among the investment broker realm for its customer service, $0 trade commissions and large selection of mutual funds. From its origination the company has been all about making investing accessible to everyone.   o	In line with this vision, Charles Schwab acquired rival firm TD Ameritrade three years ago. TD Ameritrade now provides investing and trading services for 11 million client accounts that total more than $1 trillion in assets, and custodial services for more than 6,000 independent registered investment advisors. Many Americans actively trade on TD or manage their own ROTH IRAs through the platform, offering them tax benefits/advice and very flexible options for managing their own retirement funds. TD's Roth IRA has zero annual account fees or management fees.   The Chart   o	You can see a potential Long Term Ascending Triangle playing out.   o	There is an underside diagonal support line.   o	The beauty of this trade is the following:   -	A defined stop loss level at $45.39   -	A potential 85% upside to  12% downside (Adjust to suit your tolerance).   -	A bounce of the top of the ascending triangle is promising.   o	Any time we have been this oversold on the RSI we have made a significant upside move (green circles on the chart).   o	The average performance after the green oversold RSI levels is an 82% price increase within a 12 months.   o	If there is one thing we can take away from this chart it is that if we reach down into RSI oversold levels again this would be a great opportunity.   o	Regardless I am proposing the trade based off the pattern and recent oversold RSI. Since this recent oversold level we have had an approximate 50% increase in price and a 27% retraction/decline back down to the ascending triangle base.   o	For those of you who want to lower your risk you can raise the stop loss to a 5% decline ($48.00) or you can wait until over sold levels present themselves again.   Important to note that Charles Schwab is not a Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIB) like Citibank and the likes. This makes this a higher risk trade, especially if we are looking long term over a 52 week period. Regardless, it is a well-established bank providing some of the leading brokerage services to the US public including management of ROTH IRAs, the cornerstone of most Americans retirement planning. One could argue, its systemically important without being a member of the G-SIB.   As always, stay nimble in this market, do not enter a trade without a stop loss at a risk level you can tolerate. Same goes with position size. With this stock 50% down from highs way back in Feb 2022 this maybe an opportunity to claw onto this long term rising trend near it lower diagonal support line.   PUKA"

The oral, once-daily, selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator will be marketed by the brand name of Velsipity (2 mg dose).   The approval for etrasimod was based on data from two pivotal phase III studies, ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE 12. These studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of a daily 2mg dose of oral etrasimod in UC patients who had failed treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Both studies achieved their primary endpoint of clinical remission over placebo and all key secondary endpoints.   An application seeking the approval of etrasimod is also under review in the EU, with a decision from the European Medicines Agency anticipated in first-half 2024.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.12%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.23%.   The electric utility's stock has dropped by 7.77% in the past month, exceeding the Utilities sector's loss of 10.36% and lagging the S&P 500's loss of 2.4%.   The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Duke Energy in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on November 2, 2023. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.03, indicating a 14.04% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $8.2 billion, indicating a 2.97% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.   Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Duke Energy. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability."

Consumer Staples traded with a forward operating P/E north of 20 while the uninspiring and often-safe Utilities space briefly had an earnings multiple above 22. Real Estate, meanwhile, has endured steep absolute and relative selling over the last many quarters as the ramifications of COVID's reshaping of the work environment continue to evolve.   I took a look at those three sector ETFs (XLP, XLU, XLRE) and plotted price action on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT). The ""long bond"" sports a yield of just under 5%, and you'll find that TLT's yield-to-maturity is higher than that given its exposure to the 20-year bond (which almost always has a yield premium to the more liquid 30-year). The result of sharp Treasury-market selling since May, and particularly since the beginning of the Q2 earnings season in mid-July, is that so-called ""defensive"" sectors have been big losers.   I assert that if we see yields pare their gains into year-end, then the usual mid-October through early January rally could be led by this island of misfit sectors. Consider that the 5% mark on the yield curve is a key psychological level - I would not be surprised to see bond buyers step in over the next handful of weeks. All bets are off next year, though, as it appears a longer-term cycle of higher yields is in place."

2023-10-17 10:38:58,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BLK/lXfgpWJg-Black-rocks-Bitcoin-ETF-Saga/,"Fact: The US Securities and Exchange Commission Will Not Appeal the Grayscale (GBTC) ETF Ruling   A Bitcoin Trust is a financial vehicle where investors pool their funds to buy and hold Bitcoin. Bitcoin Trusts operate like a traditional investment and are traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) stock exchange. Bitcoin Trusts indirectly own Bitcoin through the trusts holdings.   Conversely, a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin and is traded on stock exchanges, just like a stock. ETF investors buy shares of the fund, which in turn owns Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs are more optimal because they directly own Bitcoin, and offer investors more liquidity and flexibility than Bitcoin Trusts.   Grayscale runs the worlds largest Bitcoin Trust. However, Grayscale has been working to clear the red tape of switching from a Bitcoin Trust to an ETF for the past two years. Because the SEC did not act before the Friday deadline, the SEC will not appeal an August court loss over Grayscales ETF conversion application. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Grayscale spokeswoman said: The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SECs approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable.   Fiction: The SEC Approved Blackrocks (BLK) Bitcoin ETF   Early Monday morning, CoinTelegraph, one of cryptos most followed news sites, tweeted news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had approved Blackrocks Ishares spot Bitcoin ETF. As a result, Bitcoin spiked to two-month highs and neared the psychologically important $30,000 level before reversing. However, there was one major problem  the tweet was a hoax. A few hours after sending Bitcoin soaring, CoinTelegraph retracted its tweet and said it was investigating why false news was spread. Meanwhile, Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager, confirmed that the headline was false and said the Bitcoin application is still under review by the SEC."

Have a look at $NASDAQ:FUTU. High double and triple digits growths of earnings and sales four quarters in a row; strong and consistent ROE numbers; high eps growth estimates. Management owns 5% of the company. In conjunction with China government plans to stimulate the economy, most of the ingredients are there to support potential price advance of FUTU into Q4.   From the technical stand point, I may suggest several perspective:   1. My wave-analysis shows that a) the mid/long-term structure allows for substantial upside and b) price found important short-term support in 53 area and is now building the base before continuing advance towards next important resistance zones: 80-99.   2. Waves and fibonacci aside, notice how well the price creates a volatility contraction pattern on a weekly time-scale, with an evident accumulation signs and good weekly closes. That leads me to consider that sellers with selling volume are subsiding and buyers are ready to step in leading the price higher.   Overall there is quite substantial overhead supply from devastating 90% decline since 2021, strong fundamental and at least short to mid term technical stance make   FUTU   a valid candidate for the buy list.   Trading thesis:   if price manages to break-out above 67.5 with supportive volume confirmation, that shall be a buy signal. With tight 3-5-7% staggered stop loss. For cowboy type of traders, price moving above  64.10 could be a place to start opening the position with an intention of adding after 67.5 breach.

2023-10-17 05:27:25,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/BUD/ZBSWZw52-Go-woke-go-broke-Anheuser-Busch/,"From a technical perspective, Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) presents an attractive opportunity due to a substantial drawdown of over 20% since April, attributed to a perceived shift toward 'wokeness.' This phenomenon, commonly expressed as ""go woke go broke,"" often reflects boycotts against companies embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion, or, in AB InBev's case, partnering with transgender influencers. However, this negative sentiment has potentially led to AB InBev being undervalued.   The uniqueness of this situation lies in AB InBev's diverse brand portfolio. Many of its brands are not immediately associated with the company, and while certain recognizable ones may face boycotts, the other brands continue to thrive. Notably, several of these brands hold higher market values than the more affordable ones that have been boycotted, which suggests that this strategic diversity could benefit the company.   Additionally, as the outrage associated with 'wokeness' appears to be subsiding, AB InBev may find itself in a more favorable market position. Furthermore, in times of economic uncertainty or conflict, consumer demand for alcoholic beverages typically increases, and AB InBev's comprehensive product range positions it well to meet this potential surge in demand.

While inflation continues to be sticky in March, the FED will continue increasing interest rates and won`t stop until something cracks in the economy. Another 25bps increase.   - The market is expected to react and the SPY will reach $376.   3. They year will end in a positive note, the was in Ukraine will end and the supply chain disruption that was one of the factors of high inflation, will be restored. Inflation don to 3%.

The thing is though, that the macro story for the core of their business has never been better as demand for natural gas and LNG transfer will only increase as geopolitical tension rises in the Middle East and Russia continues their offensive, all while Biden admin is on track to completely deplete the SPR for the sake of keeping US oil prices stable.   TELL has a huge opportunity to explode here...   Though, they are yet to find a partner to secure FID in the amount of I believe $14.5b for their Driftwood LNG plant in Louisiana. The longer they continue construction without this decision being made, the higher their bankruptcy risk becomes. As soon as they get it, however, investors will pile in money and the impact on price will be monstrous.   Positive developments in FID situation should bring us to dashed line.   Securing of FID could break the uptrend, in an overly optimistic case, and likely over a 1-2 year timeframe.

Otherwise the 14-16 becomes a greater likelihood and then will have to start seeing if the projections of the move line up to that target of $14-16.   Not financial advice"

As political tensions rise high in the world, we are due for another market correction and overall world market corrections. USA of course is protecting its interest in the Middle East and as we can see, Israel-Palestine conflict is only getting started. This is a multi-decade war between Israel and Arab/Muslim states.   However, this war is not going to be similar to previous, this will be final and deciding war in that region, after which, nothing will be left there and geographical borders will change. This is a political game because of all the resources hidden, particularly Oil, in the Middle East. I believe this time we will see a use of nuclear weapons.   There will be de-stabilization in that region and rest of the world. UVXY will spike due to this. I'm not sure about my timing, but I see these tensions rising very high and markets staying volatile within near future.

We also always had breaks and retests of the previous highs which were followed by crazy pumps and I do expect the same thing to happen again.   -------------------------------------------------------------------   Most of the people always follow the quick money.

(LUV) and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK). These are two significant players in the domestic airline sector. Both airlines have their own set of merits and challenges, which opens up a trading opportunity. I'm contemplating going long on LUV and short on ALK, capitalizing on their unique differences and aiming for a reversion to their historical performance relationship.   Why Go Long on Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV):   Valuation:   LUV has a P/E ratio of 29.67, which is slightly higher than ALK's P/E of 27.84. However, LUV's forward P/E of 11.56 is more attractive compared to ALK's forward P/E of 5.84, offering better growth prospects.   Profitability:   LUV's ROA and ROE stand at 1.55% and 5.30% respectively. Though these are similar to ALK's, LUV's anticipated growth in EPS for the next year is 35.28%, suggesting better future profitability.   Performance Metrics:   LUV has been underperforming with a YTD drop of -23.83%, but its higher EPS growth rate for the next year makes it a candidate for a rebound.   Why Short Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK):   Valuation:   ALK's P/E ratio of 27.84 and forward P/E of 5.84 may look attractive, but when adjusted for growth (PEG), ALKs 1.63 is less appealing, indicating a potential overvaluation.   Short Interest:   ALK has a short float of 3.41%, hinting at some degree of negative sentiment, which makes it a candidate for a short position.   Profitability:   ALKs ROA and ROE are 1.08% and 4.13% respectively, and it has a lower projected growth rate for next year, making it less appealing for a long position.   Performance Metrics:   ALK's recent performance has been troubling, with a decline of -35.85% in the last quarter and -18.21% over the last year, reinforcing the short decision.   Decision:   Long on 1 LUV   Short on 1 ALK"

To compare TSLA's last ABCDE triangle that was noteworthy we'll look back in 2020 with the S&P inclusion news. Not saying there will be any bullish news this time but the pattern is all set up either way.   ---   Looking for a head and shoulder to form and drop down to the lower trendline + golden pocket. This will finish the ABCDE triangle pattern.   Keep in mind TSLA does not have to reach the lower trendline. It's possible the higher low can be front ran.   ---   Weekly Chart   - Ultimately must break thru the trendline that has been weighing TSLA down since its all time high   - TSLA looks to be in a rising channel from its bottom.

2023-10-16 17:23:47,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/MxJrwwOw-Understanding-the-Role-of-HFTs-and-Dark-Pools-for-Day-Trading/,"TSLA   reports on Wednesday of this week, October 18th. Last quarter, it had a gap down on its earnings news based on Year over Year comparisons which triggered High Frequency Trading (HFTs) to gap the stock down. Quarter over Quarter, however,   TSLA   has shown consistent growth this year.   The problem with determining if the HFT gaps are likely to gap down or up on the next earnings report is the very low Percentage of Shares Held by Giant Buy-Side Institutions (PSHI). TSLAs CEO has lost the necessary confidence of the largest Buy-Side Institutions in the world. So it's institutional interest is extremely low for such an important US company.  The Buy-Side Institutions want the Board of Directors to replace Musk with someone who is more focused on TSLA to help it grow. The PSHI is likely to remain low until a new CEO is chosen.   The highest the PSHI has ever been was in July 2020 when it reached a high of 71%.  It dropped to a low of 43% in November of 2021 and the stock has been sideways with very low PSHI ever since. It is very rare to see such low PSHI in a young new technology company with such high growth potential.   With less support from largest most influential institutions, the HFTs, which use retail news as one of their 6 primary algorithm triggers for automated orders as Maker/Takers, often gap a stock down on earnings news that was actually not negative.   Smaller Fund Managers, who have a special SEC classification with lower reporting requirements, often have VWAP automated orders trigger on high volume surges. This is often mistaken by smaller funds and retail investors or traders as Dark Pool high volume activity, when it is not.   High PSHI creates a natural liquidity draw and thus more momentum and speculative price action. This is missing much of the time for   TSLA   stock price movement.   The current sideways trend has existed since 2021, best seen on a Weekly Chart. The dimensions of the sideways trend and the irregularity of the price range determines whether the sideways trend is a Long Term Wide Trading Range, a Short Term Trading Range, a Wide Sideways Trend, or a Platform-Building Sideways Trend. This is a Long Term Trading Range due to the inconsistent highs and lows.   This is common in a stock that has PSHI below 60%.   On a Daily Chart, the fundamentals currently are within the rectangular shape outlined below.   This area of price can be problematic for retail day traders as there are always portfolio adjustments going on by the Buy-Side Institutions who have ETFs and Index funds with TSLA as a component.   When the stock drops below that Buy Zone range, it quickly reverses and runs up into the lows of that fundamental range. This becomes a price range where there is conflict between retail day traders trying to trade on news and the Buy-Side Institutions accumulating inventory shares of TSLA for the Indexes or ETF Trust accounts that must maintain a value close to the ETF or index value upon which that ETF is based.   What happens intraday is a very choppy and indecisive price action up and down that causes whipsaw losses for day trading.   In order to successfully day-trade TSLA, these factors must be understood to use to one's advantage. This requires an understanding of how to identify a Dark Pool Sell Zone or a Dark Pool Buy Zone within the daily charts.  It also requires an understanding of how HFTs trigger and how VWAP orders often cause whipsaw action as well.   Remember that Dark Pool data is not available during the trading day. That data is on Over-the-Counter Alternative Transaction Systems. Those orders are filled off the exchanges and are not transmitted to the National Clearing Houses until after the market closes.   Hence, ALL retail day traders are trading against an invisible entity whose orders they cant see even on Level 2 screens. The art of day trading in harmony with Dark Pool activity requires what I call ""Relational Technical Analysis."""

In the context of trading, this might mean beginning with a macroeconomic analysis, industry analysis, or a broad market overview before delving into individual securities or specific trading strategies. This approach helps traders gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall market conditions.   2. Major Pivots:   Major pivots refer to critical points or levels in the market that often act as turning points for price action. These could include support and resistance levels, trendlines, or significant historical price points. Traders use these pivots to make decisions regarding entry and exit points in their trading strategies.   3. TradingVolatility's Calculated Cumulative Gamma Levels:   TradingVolatility appears to be a tool or platform that provides data and insights related to options trading, including the calculation of cumulative gamma levels. Gamma represents the rate of change in an option's delta concerning a change in the underlying asset's price. Cumulative gamma levels can indicate the overall sensitivity of a portfolio to changes in the underlying asset's price. Traders use this data to assess risk exposure and to make informed decisions.   4. Highest Three Expiration Strikes:   Options have various expiration dates and strike prices. The highest three expiration strikes refer to the options contracts with the most significant open interest or trading activity. These are often the ones that have the most influence on market dynamics and can be crucial in managing options portfolios.   Now, let's put these elements together:   By employing a top-down approach, traders start with a macro-level analysis of the market. They then identify major pivots, which could be key support and resistance levels, trendlines, or important historical price levels. This step helps traders establish the broader context for their trading decisions.   Next, traders use TradingVolatility's calculated cumulative gamma levels. These levels offer insights into the sensitivity of their options portfolios to changes in the underlying asset's price. By aligning these gamma levels with the highest three expiration strikes, traders can gain a clearer picture of their risk exposure and the potential impact of major market movements on their portfolios.   For instance, if the cumulative gamma levels are high near these critical pivots, it suggests that options traders have substantial exposure to potential price swings in the underlying asset. This information can guide traders in making decisions about risk management, such as adjusting their positions, implementing hedges, or selecting strategies that align with their risk tolerance.   In summary, a top-down approach, combined with a focus on major pivots and cumulative gamma levels of the highest three expiration strikes, provides traders with a well-rounded perspective on market conditions and risk exposure, helping them make more informed trading decisions and manage their portfolios effectively."

Other times, it turns into a violent storm, leaving in its wake financial destruction, memories of the past, and hope that better times are yet to come.   Occidental Petroleum Corporation (often abbreviated as Oxy in reference to the symbol and logo) is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States and the Middle East, as well as petrochemical production in the United States, Canada and Chile.

The Buffett conglomerate bought nearly 5.8 million shares of the oil company over multiple trading sessions in March, at prices ranging from $59.85 to $61.90, according to the documents.   Berkshire now owns 200.2 million shares of Occidental, totaling 22.2% of the oil company's shares, up from 21.4% previously.   Occidental shares are currently among the top 10 Berkshire holdings. The energy company outperformed the S&P 500 index last year, more than doubling in price.   In March,   OXY   CEO Vicki Hollub said in an interview with CNBC that she met with the 92-year-old investor, noting that they talked about the oil and gas industry and related technologies.   Last August, Berkshire received regulatory approval to buy up to 50% of Occidental, sparking speculation that Berkshire could eventually buy out the entire Occidental company.   Berkshire also owns $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million shares of common stock for $5 billion, or $59.62 each. The warrants were obtained as part of the company's 2019 deal that helped finance the purchase of Anadarko Occidental.   While many investors even now continue to believe in the crypto-snow that melted without a trace the winter before last, the technical picture indicates the possibility of Growth comtinuation in value investment assets, incl. Occidental Petroleum  - after the completion of the 0.618x Fibonacci retrace to the Growth that began later to Russian President ""Special Military Operation"" announcement in Q1'22.

2023-10-16 15:28:33,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/PCTI/Rmcp4ctg-Another-long-term-downtrend-broken/,"Here is another stock potentially breaking out of a long-term downtrend/basing pattern.  I tried to put the trend line where there were the most hits so that it would be more accurate, but that resulted in some false breakouts in the past and, as a result, this could prove to be a false breakout or that the trend line isn't even accurate and there was no breakout.  But the potential breakout occurred on strong volume, which is a good sign.  Based on the assumption that a long-term downtrend has indeed been broken, I like this stock long-term.  I don't like to set price targets, but rather set a stop loss and keep increasing it if a stock continues to rise.  If this ends up proving to be a false breakout, or not even a breakout at all as I've stated my trend line might not be good, a break below long-term support of about $4 would be a very bad sign, but also potentially very good at shaking out the last of the weak hands.  Think about it, if you had the ability and really wanted to shake out the weak hands, you would manipulate a false breakout here followed by a big shakeout below previous long-term support where you could buy at dirt cheap prices and then take the stock up for the move everyone thought would initially happen.   This is not advice, just a very simple observation of a long-term chart pattern, decide for yourself and if you decide to trade this move, do so at your own risk.  I'm a long-term investor, so I like to trade on longer-term moves and therefore and willing to take more risk - it wouldn't bother me if this stock had a shakeout following this potential breakout, but for short-term traders it would probably be too much to risk going through something like that, or their tighter stops would be taken out before the stock really gets going.  I'm good with that as it adds long-term strength and more potential movement long-term."

They would feel a lot better if profit margins looked like they were bottoming out.   Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is due to report third-quarter numbers Wednesday evening. Wall Street is looking for earnings per share of about 73 cents, down from 77 cents a couple of weeks ago. Its coming in a little after the company delivered some 435,000 vehicles in the third quarter, missing Wall Street estimates by about 20,000 units.   Price targets are coming down with the estimates. On Monday, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter cut his target on Tesla stock to $290 a share from $300, though he still has a Buy rating on Tesla stock. While Cybertruck is due to be delivered soon, he sees shares trading sideways, at best, in the coming months. He wants profit margins to bottom and delivery growth to accelerate before investors get more excited about the stock.   He has a point about margins. Automotive gross profit margins have been coming down with prices for new Tesla vehicles. The price for a new long-range Model Y is down roughly 25% from peak levels. Teslas automotive gross profit margin in the second quarter came in at about 18%, down from a peak of about 30% in the first quarter of 2022.   Wedbush analyst Dan Ives agrees that investors will be laser-focused on profit margins. He sees automotive gross profit margins coming in around 17% for the third quarter, but investors are probably ready for a weak third quarter. What they want is a sign from management that margins are bottoming out."

The franchisee provides residential and commercial real estate brokerage services. It also provides coaching and support services to agents on a fee basis.   We are excited to welcome the franchisee into the corporate organization, said Joe La Rosa, CEO of La Rosa Holdings Corp. We believe that not only does this acquisition expand our footprint in Florida, but it will also increase our top line revenue. With future planned franchisee acquisitions, we expect both our top line and bottom line to improve considerably as our current infrastructure is set up to support five times our current agent count. We have a brokerage model which is agent centric with 100% commission. In our view, our agent-centric commission model enables our sales agents to obtain higher net commissions than they would otherwise receive from many of our competitors in our local markets. We provide our real estate brokers and sales agents who are seeking financial independence with a turnkey solution and support them in growing their brokerages while they fund their own businesses. This enables us to maintain a low fixed-cost business model with several recurring revenue streams, yielding relatively high margins and cash flow. Moreover, we believe that our proprietary technology, training, and the support that we provide to our agents at a minimal cost to them is one of the best offered in the industry. Our strategy is to drive exponential growth to capitalize on the changing agency model trends occurring in the industry.   La Rosa is a holding company for five agent-centric, technology-integrated, cloud-based, multi-service real estate companies. In addition to providing person-to-person residential and commercial real estate brokerage services to the public, the Company cross-sells ancillary technology-based products and services primarily to its sales agents and the sales agents associated with their franchisees. La Rosas business is organized based on the services they provide internally to their agents and to the public, which are residential and commercial real estate brokerage, franchising, real estate brokerage education and coaching, and property management. La Rosa has six La Rosa Realty corporate real estate brokerage offices located in Florida, 27 La Rosa Realty franchised real estate brokerage offices in six states in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Companys real estate brokerage offices, both corporate and franchised, are staffed with more than 2,380 licensed real estate brokers and sales associates."

Despite what the general public might believe, bear markets do not end when conditions finally improve. They end at the moment of peak bearishness  when everyone has given up hope and is sure the market is toast. When the final bull throws in the towel... thats when we get a bottom.   The big level I am watching is 420 on the SPY  an ETF representing the S&P 500 index (white dashed line on the chart below). The significance of this cannot be understated.   First, this is the current level of the indexs 200-day moving average. Long-term institutional investors watch the 200-day as a proverbial line in the sand to dictate whether the market is trending higher or lower. A close below this level triggers sell orders and limits new buys in many trading systems.   This is also the breakout area from the beginning of the year that led to the strong rally we saw in May and July. A violation of this level means all of those gains have been wiped out.   It should not come as a surprise that the market found support here last week. But I do not expect it to hold.   While I remain bullish on the market over the long-term, I also want to trade the wiggles. That means timing these shorter-term moves in order to make well-timed buys.   If and when the S&P breaks through this level, expect to see a quick flush lower. Lots of investors have stop losses here, either physical or mental ones, and many bulls will likely throw in the towel when the level fails.   But there is opportunity on the other side   Remember, markets bottom when things look their worst. During the great financial crisis of 2008, stocks did not bottom when economic conditions improved. They bottomed at the peak of the bad news  when everyone believed the sky was falling in March 2009.   In the COVID selloff of 2020, the bottom was made on March 23, 2020  right as lockdowns and a wave of overreaching mandates were first announced.   Last years bear market found the low on October 13th  the day of the worst inflation report in decades.   In every major market correction, the story is the same...bottoms happen when conditions are at their worst. So that is when we want to buy.   The final leg lower that I expect to play out over the coming weeks will be just such an occurrence. Auto workers striking, 23-year highs in interest rates, record lows in mortgage demand, war breaking out in the Middle East, a rapidly rising national debt, and a technical sell signal in the major indexes - this will likely create the peak bearishness moment I am looking for that will flush out the bag holders and trigger the final sales to end this pullback.   And that is where I will be waiting ready to buy before the next great bull market gets underway."

Amazon, with its vast financial resources, recently committed $4 billion to Anthropic, the creators of AI assistant Claude, in a deal that positions Amazon Web Services (AWS) as Anthropic's primary cloud services provider. The partnership could significantly boost AWS sales, but is Amazon an attractive buy?   Anthropic's Expertise in Generative AI   Anthropic specializes in generative AI, a technology applicable in customer service, AI assistant development, and coding assistance. The company equips clients with a toolkit to craft AI models tailored to their specific needs. With Amazon's investment, Anthropic's data and models will reside on AWS, creating a seamless collaboration between the two companies.   Boosting AWS   This investment could provide a much-needed boost for AWS, which has faced challenges recently, with slower growth rates and declining profitability. As the cloud computing market is projected to grow to $2.4 trillion by 2030, leadership in this sector is crucial.   Strengthening Amazon's AI Position   While Amazon's investment in Anthropic may not be a game-changer, it strengthens Amazon's position in AI, where it lags behind competitors. This $4 billion investment grants Amazon a minority ownership stake in Anthropic and enhances AWS's competitiveness in cloud computing.   AWS's Significance   AWS accounted for 70% of Amazon's operating income in the second quarter, highlighting its importance to the company's profitability. Amazon's transition from a consumer goods-oriented company to a tech-oriented one is evident in its improved gross margins over the past decade.   A Buying Opportunity   Amazon's stock presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, given its strategic positioning to benefit from AI advancements. If Amazon can restore its high profit margins and invigorate AWS, it has the potential for substantial gains, as the market isn't currently pricing it for perfection.

Sales of Apples flagship device are down 4.5% compared with the iPhone 14 over their first 17 days after release, market tracker Counterpoint Research estimated in previously unreported figures provided to Bloomberg News. Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee reckoned sales of the iPhone 15 were down by an even sharper double-digit percentage from its predecessor after Huawei outsold Apple overall, powered by the surprising debut of the Mate 60 Pro.   The twin reports mark a potential blow to Apple at a time its grappling with the weakest smartphone demand in a decade and a backlash from overheating models. If the initial estimates are accurate, they represent one of the iPhones worst debuts in China since around 2018, when local names like Oppo and Vivo began to captivate Asian consumers.   Counterpoint blamed the iPhones slump in China mainly on an economy struggling to rebound from its Covid trough. And it stressed that in the US, the iPhone 15 likely posted a double-digit rise over 2022 in the first nine days of sales.   But the iPhones debut in China came weeks after the launch of the Mate 60 Pro, celebrated as a triumph over US sanctions because of its advanced made-in-China processor. It also coincided with a government mandate to expand a ban on iPhone use to government agencies and state companies, underscoring Apples growing challenges there."

The Maranello, Italy-based luxury sports car manufacturer will subsequently extend the scheme to Europe in response to demand from its wealthy customers, Reuters reported, citing Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Enrico Galliera.   Ferrari will use crypto payments provider BitPay to process transactions in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoin USD coin (USDC) in the initial rollout in the U.S.   Some  are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies,"" Galliera said. ""Some others are more traditional investors, who want to diversify their portfolios.""   Despite crypto's popularity as an investment tool, for major companies to accept it as method of payment remains rare. In February 2021, Elon Musk's electric-car company Tesla (TSLA) began accepting bitcoin payments but discontinued the service only three months later, citing environmental concerns over the electricity usage involved in bitcoin mining.   Neither Ferrari nor BitPay immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment."

I will be watching for a break or retest of the 52 week low or a break and hold above 47.50.   A break below the 52 week low would confirm that market participants want to take the stock lower. However, a break and hold above 47.50 would confirm that participants are interested in taking the market higher.   On a lower time frame (specifically the 4H chart), data shows price broke below the .618 fibonacci retracement level and retested (see image below). The stock could potentially move lower being that it retested the .   Furthermore, price rejected the same level three times on the 1H timeframe.   Something else that should be pointed out here is the daily chart shows an increase of sellers over the last three trading sessions.   *Side note   -Interestingly, SQ is in the price area it was at the beginning of COVID-19. A break below the 52 week low may cause price to retest the low from April 2020. Should price reach the low from April 2020, we should watch to see if price finds support or breaks down further."

2023-10-15 14:55:03,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/SPY/Ku0hb5vU-SPY-Outlook/,"TF: D   Background:   The US Stock market has had a bumpy, wild ride over the last several years fueled by low interest rates, global issues, and most recently global high inflation.   The COVID-19 pandemic initially led to a market sell-off in 2020 followed by a large impulse wave to the upside as a result of ""stimulus"" checks and very low interest rates that began in 2020 and ended in 2022 with the commencement of the Fed raising rates to combat high inflation.   Beginning in January 2022 the US Stock Market dropped ~27 percent, with the low of ~$348 being hit in October 2022. Since October 2022, the US Markets have experience upside momentum with the a local current top of ~$461 being hit in July 2023. Since July 2023 the markets have experienced a downside move.   This analysis uses the pandemic market sell-off low (March 2020) and impulse high (January 2022), October 2023 low, July 2023 high to forecast the longer-term forecast for the US Markets. Fixed range volume profile is used on the March 2020 low to the January 2022 high and is used on the recent leg higher (October 2022 low to the July 2023 high) to give better insight on volume and areas of interest that may act like a magnet for price. For clarity the forecast text below is added to the chart.   SHORT-TERM TARGET (2 to 3 months):   Short-term target for price is down to ~$387. This aligns with the general of the 61.8% retracement from the $348.20 to $461.01 move (Oct 22' to July 23'). Also in this area is a high volume node that make act as magnet for price to retrace to.   LONG-TERM (Several Months to a few years):   If price makes it to this previous low (Oct 22' low) and breaks it, there is a high probability chance that price would extend down to the 161.8% ($265.91; green line) extension of the previous leg down that started in Jan 22' and continued to Oct 22'.   If price makes a double bottom around $348.77 or bounces and continue higher at ~387 then there could a chance for a rally from there...could be impulsive or only corrective. If corrective price would look to break that low (Oct. 22', $348.77).   Catalyst for deep correction -  Global issue/event/war, sticky inflation causing more rate increases, holding rates at higher levels for longer than anticipated."

2023-10-15 13:49:05,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/FRO/WF36jgyd-FRO-cup-with-handle/,"Frontline (FRO) is one of the world's largest oil tanker operators, boasting a young and modern fleet, with a particular expertise in operating Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). The global oil tanker market is currently facing significant turbulence due to European nations imposing a price ceiling of $60 per barrel on Russian crude oil, which has led to a limited supply of available tankers. This embargo and price cap have substantially increased the operational mileage of the global oil tanker fleet, rapidly driving up Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates. Demand in the Asia-Pacific region has been on the rise, particularly with China setting new records for crude oil imports. However, China's import figures appear inconsistent with other macroeconomic indicators, potentially posing risks. It is anticipated that there will be approximately 2 million barrels per day of global crude oil demand growth in the second half of the year, which bodes well for the industry. The G7's imposition of an oil price cap on Russia may affect Russian supplies and could have implications for the supply-demand balance in the global oil market.   Profitability Model: The primary means of profit generation in the oil tanker market is the difference between revenue and capital costs, as well as operating expenses, with profitability closely tied to lease rates. FRO's lease rates for VLCCs in the second quarter of 2023 indicate that its income from these vessels is the highest relative to other types of tankers, resulting in high profitability.   Fleet Status: FRO confirmed on October 9, 2023, that it has agreed to purchase 24 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) from Euronav (NYSE: EURN) at a price of $2.35 billion. This transaction will increase its overall fleet size from 65 vessels to 89, making it the largest crude oil transportation company globally. This move is expected to have a highly value-enhancing impact on earnings per share and free cash flow, improving its dividend capacity. Currently, global orders for large VLCCs are at historic lows. Historically, facing an industry characterized by low production elasticity, low VLCC vessel orders can easily lead to price increases in the future.   Financial Situation: FRO possesses robust profitability, with an EBITDA margin TTM of 52.93% and a Levered Free Cash Flow Margin of 11.17%. The dividend yield stands at 12.47%. Following the purchase of 24 large crude oil transportation vessels from EURN, revenue and profitability are expected to increase significantly. It is indeed a Cashcow stock."

Is there any upside left in the mid-term?   My analysis of the price structure suggest there at least on possibility for that in the mid-term, although...   ... on Daily time-scale   until price stays below 479 and Aug highs   , I cannot rule out one more, potentially sharp and scary, move down to important mid-term support zone: 371-307 as per green count on the chart.   Under this scenario, the price needs to find support in this area and start building the bottom and the right side of the base/cup.   Alternatively, if price manages to consolidate above Sep low and create pivot around recent 476 highs, I would be eager to consider going long with price breaking above 479 with volume support.   Trading thesis:   until price respects 479 short-term resistance area, I would lean towards the short side, with any consecutive lower-low being a shorting opportunity (orange circle on a chart above as a potential example) with stops above recent high.   Although mid-term analysis shows potential for at least one more leg up, in the short term we are in no mans land, with both sides (long/short) having technical arguments to support itself. I would wait for the dust to settle and high quality, low risk set-up to emerge before taking any decisive stance."

Its possible for a move of this size because SQ did drop this much on the week of May 9, 2022. The $10 target is based on a measured move of the sideways range.

Overall, I was expecting bullishness on NVDA, but keeping in mind that we were close to the completion of the whole move that started in October 2022.   Update:   Analysis of the Structure:   Wave   a   , which was started in October 2022 has been completed (peaked on August 24th of 2023) and now we are in wave   b   , which attempts to correct that whole bullish phase.   So far, we have completed one zigzag in wave b, shown as wave (w) and completed one wave (x). Right now, we are in wave   a   of (y) of   b   .   Is it possible not to consider this beautiful textbook h&s pattern on NVDA?

The next major trough is the 80D cycle trough expected on October 31st."

In summary, I expected bullishness at that time.   Update:   Analysis of the Structure:   I am now labeling the bullish move of October 2022 to Jun 2023 as a wave (a) of I and since then, we are in wave (b) of I, correcting that whole bullish move.   Wave (b) is developing as a triple zigzag and currently, we are starting wave y of (b). The structure of whole wave (b) has been really messy to count including very complex flat correction.   Analysis of the Cycles:   The low of September 25th was the first 40D cycle trough in the second 80D cycle of the first 20W cycle of the current 40W cycle. We are expecting a 20W cycle trough in the first week of November. This means we should get a huge amount of bearishness going into this trough, also a strong bounce out of it.   The 18M cycle trough is also expected in March 2024, which would be the wave (b) bottom."

Specifically, Nvidia's H100 Tensor Core GPU is expected to be affected by these new regulations.   Nvidia's stock movement ran counter to the Dow Jones, which experienced gains attributed to robust earnings results from JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, outperforming Wall Street consensus. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 seemed unaffected by the banks' success and moved in the opposite direction.   Nvidia's Stock and Chinese AI Chip Bans:   Last autumn, the Biden administration initiated a ban on the export of Nvidia's H100 and A100 GPUs to mainland China, both of which play pivotal roles in generative AI and military applications. Advanced Micro Devices' MI250 accelerator chip was also impacted by this ban. At the time, Nvidia estimated that the new regulations could result in up to $400 million in lost sales.   However, recent reports by Reuters reveal that the administration has identified mainland companies accessing AI chips via a loophole that allows overseas units of Chinese corporations to continue procuring these products. These foreign subsidiaries either illicitly transport the chips to the mainland or facilitate remote access to the chip technology, despite operating far outside China's borders.   According to Reuters:   ""he very chips barred by US regulations could be purchased from vendors in the famed Huaqiangbei electronics area in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.""   Complete Restriction Challenges:   It remains uncertain how Washington can effectively block China from accessing AI technology. Chinese corporations are already finding ways to access this technology through third-party channels, including Amazon Web Services, which employs these chips in its cutting-edge data centers.   As of the time of writing, Nvidia's stock has decreased by 0.8%, trading at $465 per share. However, investors need not be overly concerned. Nvidia's stock has been on an upward trajectory since it hit a low of just below $410 on September 21. This steady ascent, spanning over three and a half weeks,   shows no immediate signs of slowing down.   Nvidia continues to navigate the complex terrain of international regulations and the ever-evolving tech industry, making it a company to watch closely in the coming months."

As Tesla's market capitalization nears the $800 billion mark, investors are keeping a close eye on the possibility of the electric vehicle (EV) giant rejoining the exclusive trillion-dollar club. With several factors working in its favor, including the global shift toward EV adoption and a reputation for innovation, Tesla appears poised for further growth. However, a meteoric rise in its stock price has raised questions about the right time to invest in this industry leader.   Tesla's Dominance in the EV Market:   Tesla has undeniably solidified its position in the US EV market, strengthening its economic moat through brand recognition and cutting-edge technology. By initially targeting the high-end market and delivering innovative features via software updates, Tesla has won the hearts of many without extensive marketing efforts.   Technological Expertise:   Early-mover advantage has given Tesla a technological edge in manufacturing capabilities, software development, and hardware design. This expertise equips the company to thrive despite intensifying competition in the EV industry.   A Glimpse into the Future:   CEO Elon Musk's vision for Tesla's future is nothing short of ambitious. The company's pursuit of fully autonomous vehicles, along with a potential robotaxi service, could lead to staggering profits. Even prominent investor Cathie Wood and Ark Invest share Musk's optimism, projecting substantial revenue from autonomous ride-hailing services.   Competition and Market Challenges:   While Tesla has outperformed its rivals, competition is an ongoing concern in the expanding EV market. Established automakers and newer entrants in the US, as well as formidable Chinese competitors, pose challenges that Tesla must address.   Price Reductions and Profit Margins:   To stay competitive, Tesla has resorted to price reductions, which have contributed to narrowing profit margins. This trend is something investors should keep a close watch on.   High Valuation:   With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.6, Tesla's stock is trading at a premium valuation. This may give pause to conservative and value-oriented investors who seek reasonable valuations.   The Verdict:   While Tesla's track record and Elon Musk's innovative leadership are compelling, its current market capitalization and lofty stock price warrant a careful evaluation. Investors should consider whether Tesla can sustain significant outperformance in the coming years. Waiting for potential price pullbacks before making investment decisions might be a prudent approach.   In the dynamic world of EVs, Tesla's journey to the trillion-dollar club is one that investors will be keen to follow closely."

The purpose of this analysis is to find commonalities in price patterns and behaviour among the best-performing stocks, that repeat themselves in each and every up-cycle throughout market history. That will help new stock market participants to better exploit new emerging opportunities.   As my stock market history teacher - John Boik - use to say it: ""Study the past, so you can profit in the future"".   Retrospective analysis of Ford (   F   ) during 1982-194:   0. Great Relative strength. When SPX (see the upper chart) makes lower lows, FORD is making higher highs on noticeable pick-up in average daily volume. Also notice who price creates a flat-base and latter breaks out (BO) from it with volume surging above average;   1. First BUY could be made here with very tight 3% stop, a bit or right after W. O'Neil's shake-out + 10% rule (buy if price shakes you out and quickly reverse and runs higher by 10%) after the double bottom pattern in the bottom of the base.   2. Because of the bear market nature of the general index, quick 12-15% gain could be used to trim 1/2 or 2/3 of the position to guaranty profits, and selling the rest for break-even during the following re-test of break-out area;   3. Could be bought again during the BO of perfect VCP with tight 2.5% stop, and...   4. ...sold for the quick 5-7x return-to-risk gain.   5. When the index makes its final lower-low, F's price rebases, making a higher-low, and quickly runs higher and breaks out in Aug82 along with the SnP500.   F could be bought and shaked out during initial BO attempt, and then re-bought after price follows through in two days with volume support.   Notice how price pattern rhythms with prior Dec81-Mar82 base.   6. This big red reversal bar with substantial volume pick-up could be used to book another 15-17% gain with only initial 3-4% stop.   7. It is already clear that F is the new market leader of this new up-trend and it makes sense to track how the price acts if it corrects to 50MA (Red line) that coincides with re-tests of prior BO point.   If to zoom in into the volume dynamics of this basing actions around 50D MA, accumulation (surge in volume with closes in in upper part of the bar dominate volume on corrective bars) becomes very evident.   8. New BUY coming from this low cheat BO with massive volume support. Because the average cost was so low, one may want to move stop to break-even or tracing 50D MA.   9. Price closed in the upper third of the day - good supportive actions on the 50D MA. If stopped-out, shares could be re-bought by the end of the day or on next day BO with tight stop and low of the day.   10. Shares could be sold into this kind of climactic run above the 7 month channel line + the general market barely moves to old highs indicating relative divergence and lack of overall momentum in the market.   11. Good tight area. Could have been bought at BO and sold at BE after the BO proved to be fake one.   12. New BUY under shake-out + 10% rule with stop bellow   50D MA after it crosses the buy price. Massive volume advance on BO day acts as confirmation of large institutional interest in the stock (notice how these green volume sky-scrapers bars tend to dominate the red selling bars latter-on until the up-trend changes).   Notice again how the price shows the same character shake-out pattern it made during Dec81-Mar82 and May-Aug82. As Nicolas Darvas observed that ""stocks have characters just like people"".   13. Perfect selling area: price moves above the channel line in negative divergence to the market (index is not making higher-highs).   14. Same type of character behaviour with shake-out and Mark Minervine's slingshot move on volume support, where shake-out +10% buy rule could be used to establish the position with tight stop bellow the short-term 8/21emas.   15. Sell 3/4 of position or all in this first evident distribution bar + the market seems tired and is loosing momentum.   Very noticeable distribution bars starting to appear - some heavy selling and not much buying.   Important sign of character change.   16. This low volume pattern during this up-move shows that late retail buyers are stepping in with no institutional support.   That is the hint that price advance is prone to failure.   17. Definite selling signal. Price dives bellow 50MA with substantial distribution started dominating the volume pattern."

Analysis of the Cycles:   We will get the first 20D cycle trough of the second 40D cycle of the current 80D cycle on Monday (October 16th). The cross of the 20D FLD has generated a target of 244 for this trough (the underlying trend of this cycle is flat, so the target should be exactly met).   A very important thing that happened this week was the rejection of price that we got on Tuesday by the 80D FLD, which points to the bearishness on TSLA. We may also get a cross of the 40D VTL in the coming week that will confirm that the peak of the current 80D cycle is already in, as we are expecting.   Note that this upcoming 40D cycle trough is also the 80D cycle trough due to the principle of synchronicity.   The 40D cycle trough is expected from October 31st to November 6th (wave III bottom). The 40D cycle FLD which will be crossed next week can generate a target of 228 for that trough.   The 80D cycle FLD has been crossed twice to the downside, which will give a range of target: 207-233.   Overall, I depend on the fib target of 197.10 happening October 31st to November 6th."

The 200-day SMA is a critical level to watch. A sustained move above it might signal a longer-term bullish trend.   Fibonacci Retracements   : The price seems to be hovering around the 0.382 retracement level, which has been a resistance area in the past. A breakout above this could target the 0.5 and then the 0.618 levels.   MACD   : The MACD is currently below the zero line and is showing a bearish crossover, indicating possible bearish momentum in the short term.   RSI   : RSI is slightly above 40, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.   Stochastic Oscillator   : The stochastic is moving upwards, approaching overbought territory (above 80), suggesting potential bullish momentum in the short term.   Bollinger Bands   : The stock price is in the lower half of the Bollinger Band range, indicating a potential for a price rise.   Fundamental Analysis:   Valuation: The price to earnings ratio (P/E) stands at 105.23, which is relatively high compared to historical standards, suggesting that the stock might be overvalued.   Growth & Profitability: The company seems to have seen a dip in its recent performance, with decreasing margins.   Revenue Breakdown: Amazon earns a significant portion of its revenues from online stores and third-party seller services, showing its dominance in e-commerce.   Estimates: The earnings estimate for the recent year seems to be lower than the actual, potentially indicating better-than-expected performance.   Dividends: Amazon does not pay dividends, which means they might be reinvesting all their profits back into the company for growth.   Financial Health: Debt levels have been steady, indicating that the company is not heavily leveraging its growth.   Overall Trading Recommendation and Conclusion:   Short-term Outlook: The recent move above the 50-day SMA and the rising stochastic suggest potential bullish momentum. The next resistance to watch is the 200-day SMA.   Medium-term Outlook: While the stock shows signs of consolidation, the bearish MACD crossover might indicate potential downward momentum. The 0.5 Fibonacci level can act as a key resistance, while the 0.382 level is a crucial support.   Fundamental View: The high P/E ratio might be a concern for some investors looking for value. However, the solid revenue breakdown and stable debt levels highlight the company's strong fundamentals. The lack of dividends indicates a growth-focused approach.   Considering both technical and fundamental aspects, traders should be cautious with their positions, setting appropriate stop losses and taking profits at key resistance levels. Always ensure to do thorough research and possibly consult with a financial advisor before making trading decisions."

Price fell below its all time low of $10.35 on the monthly time frame, and is currently at $8.62.   Amc tested this level several times in 2020 (orange horizonal line,) but never did it close below this level.   There's 22 days left in September so there's still time for price to close above $10.35.   If price closes September below $10.35, we then would need October's candle to also close below $10.35 to confirm a possible fall into no man's land.   I call it no man's land because there's no support under $10.35, and price could literally fall into the pennies.  Not saying this will happen, but with no support left, AMC needs to close the month over $10.35 to get out of this quicksand.   Looking at the RSI and Stochastics, when both indicators dipped below their white horizontal lines at the same time (purple circles,)  this was a good time to accumulate.   Both accumulation periods resulted in over 50% rises.   Currently the Stochastics has started to break below the 20 level, and momentum is falling.

Our goal is to find a low support point and enter. It can be referred to as buying at the pullback point. The pullback point can be found with a Fibonacci extension of 61.80%. This is a step to find entry level. 1) Find a triangle (Fibonacci Speed Fan Line) that connects the high (resistance) and low (support) points of the stock in progress, where it is continuously expressed as a Slingshot, 2) and create a Fibonacci extension level for the first rising wave from the start point of slingshot pattern.   When the current price goes over 61.80% level , that can be a good entry point, especially if the SMA 100 and 200 curves are gathered together at 61.80%, it is a very good entry point.   As a great help, tradingview provide these Fibonacci speed fan lines and extension levels with ease. So if you use the Fibonacci fan line, the extension level, and the SMA 100/200 curve well, you can find an entry point for the stock market. At least you have to enter at this low point to avoid trading failure, and if you are skilled at entering this low point, with fibonacci6180 technique, your reading skill to chart will be greatly improved.   If you want to do day trading, please set the time frame to 5 minutes or 15 minutes, and you will see many of the low point of rising stocks.   If want to prefer long term range trading, you can set the time frame to 1 hr or 1 day."

2023-10-14 15:31:08,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/QQQ/Ffxj6rWV-High-Frequency-Trading-Deep-Dive-into-its-Multifaceted-Impact/,"Introduction   High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is often depicted as the epitome of technological advancements in the financial sector. As an ultra-fast trading method, HFT employs sophisticated algorithms and high-speed data networks to execute countless trades in milliseconds. While HFT accounts for a significant portion of daily trading volumes globally, its implications, both positive and negative, are intricate and multifaceted.   Historical Background   Before delving into the complexities of HFT, it's essential to understand its historical roots. Initially emerging in the late 1990s and early 2000s, HFT rose as electronic exchanges became prevalent. The rapid decline in trade execution costs and the simultaneous explosion of computational capabilities allowed trading firms to explore this new frontier.   The Mechanics of High-Frequency Trading   At its core, HFT systems continuously monitor multiple exchanges and asset classes, seeking tiny, often fleeting, arbitrage opportunities. Using predictive analytics and complex algorithms, HFT can detect and exploit price discrepancies faster than any human trader.   Example   :   If HFT systems notice a stock is priced at $50.00 on Exchange A but $50.01 on Exchange B, they can buy from A and sell on B, making a micro-profit. When scaled to millions of trades daily, these profits become significant.   The Advantages   1. Increased Market Liquidity:   HFT systems, constantly executing buy and sell orders, lead to increased trading volume, offering more liquidity in the market.   2. Reduced Bid-Ask Spreads:   The continuous flow of orders often results in narrower bid-ask spreads, which can lead to minimal trading costs for the average investor.   3. Immediate Price Adjustments:   HFT's speed means financial markets can adjust and react to news instantly, leading to more accurate pricing of assets.   4. Profits and Innovations in the Financial Sector:   Leading HFT firms often pour their substantial profits back into research and development, advancing trading technologies even further.   The Shortcomings   1. Systemic Risks:   The speed at which HFT operates means that errors, either in judgment or technology, can amplify across the financial system rapidly.   2. Market Manipulation Concerns:   Some argue that HFT allows for dubious strategies like ""quote stuffing"" or ""layering,"" where traders flood the market with orders they have no intention of filling, creating false signals.   3. Unequal Playing Field:   HFT firms often have access to better technology and data feeds than the average trader, leading to concerns of inequality.   4. Flash Crashes:   High-speed trading can exacerbate market volatility, leading to sudden and severe ""flash crashes.""   Notable Events   The Flash Crash of 2010:   On May 6, 2010, U.S. financial markets saw a rapid decline and recovery, with some stocks momentarily losing almost their entire value. While the exact cause remains debated, HFT is often cited as a contributing factor.   Knight Capital Catastrophe:   In August 2012, a software glitch in Knight Capital's HFT system executed a multitude of unintended trades, causing a loss of $440 million in mere hours and nearly bankrupting the firm.   Regulatory Challenges   The rise of HFT has posed significant challenges for regulators worldwide. Traditional market oversight mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with the sheer speed and volume of high-frequency trades. Regulators grapple with striking a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring market fairness and stability.   The Future of HFT   With technological advancements showing no signs of slowing down, the future landscape of HFT is poised for further evolution. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly being integrated into trading algorithms, offering even faster and more accurate trade executions.   However, with these advancements come renewed challenges and concerns. The integration of AI into HFT could potentially lead to unforeseen market behaviors and complexities.   Conclusion   High-Frequency Trading stands at the crossroads of technology, finance, ethics, and regulation. Its undeniable impact on market liquidity and efficiency is juxtaposed with concerns about fairness, stability, and systemic risk. As we venture further into the digital age, the role and ramifications of HFT in global financial markets will undoubtedly remain a focal point of discussions, debates, and decisions for industry stakeholders and regulators alike."

2023-10-14 13:14:33,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/LIN/5TMd4l8j-Linde-plc-LIN/,"Linde, Timeless Excellence   Linde is a timeless business with even better stability than other basic materials businesses. The company works in gases and has a near-unbroken EPS growth record of 8% annually   Linde is a market leader, and if you invest in the company, you're investing in the world's largest company for industrial gases. The company was originally a result of a takeover of British BOC in 2006, and again the 2018 merger of Linde and Praxair, a US company.   On the macro upside, there was a 1) supportive regulatory framework in the USA and in the EU on green opportunities and hydrogen, 2) the Ukraine invasion was also a key catalyst towards the energy transition, 3) the EU chip acts with 43 billion in supporting funds as well as the United States Chips and Science Act development for a value of approximately $52 billion, and 4) higher needs of specialty gas in EV car. Related to the micro upside, the company is more diversified on a GEO revenue basis and sells different product solutions starting from cylinders to bulk liquid. In addition with a follow-up note titled ""Positive News Ahead"", we reported Linde's lower cost structure with the Frankfort delisting. Aside from removing the dual listing expenses, we positively view this development because US companies' P/E multiple are usually higher compared to the EU one.   To support our MACRO buy case recap, in the second quarter, Linde announced two new projects with Evonik and Heidelberg Materials (both companies covered by our internal team). The company signed a long-term agreement to produce green hydrogen for Evonik in a 9-megawatt alkaline electrolyzer plant in Singapore. With Heidelberg, Linde will build a large-scale carbon capture close to the Lengfurt plant in Germany. As a reminder, cement production is estimated to be responsible for around 7% of global   in 2022, APD's earnings per share were at $8.38, and Linde's earnings per share were fairly similar at $8.23. For 2023, Air Products and Chemical EPS guide a midpoint at $11.40 while Linde's EPS is forecasted at $13.65. Looking at the ROCE, in Q4 2022, APD stood at 11.7% and Linde at 13.4%. In the last quarter, APDs ROCE was flat on the two-year comparison, while Lindes after-tax ROCE reached 24.0%.   While there are some business & regional nuances between the two leading companies (for instance, APD is lacking U.S. packaged gas business), here at the Lab, we believe are more inclined toward Linde, particularly when organic growth has been fairly similar. Cross-checking APD and Linde's last quarter results, we should recall that on a comparable basis, the German player volumes were flat with an average selling price up by 8%. On the other hand, APD increased its volume by 6% with an increase in the average selling price of 8% too. APD adj EBITDA grew by 13% while Linde achieved a plus 11%. However, Linde's EU exposure is greater than APD. Therefore, this is supportive of Linde's bottom line. In numbers, excluding the Engineering divisional performance, Linde's EMEA sales reached $2,177 million and represented 29.72% of the company's total sales. Compared to Q1 2022 number, turnover grew by 10% and was driven by a 13% of cost pass-through increase."

2023-10-14 13:09:05,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/INTC/CIVTqZJy-Intel-Corporation-INTC/,"Intel reported second quarter earnings on Thursday, showing a return to profitability after two straight quarters of losses and issuing a stronger-than-expected forecast. the stock rose 7% in extended trading.   Heres how Intel did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ended July 1:   Earnings per share: 13 cents, adjusted, versus a loss of 3 cents expected by Refinitiv.   Revenue: $12.9 billion, versus $12.13 billion expected by Refinitiv.   For the third quarter, Intel expects earnings of 20 cents per share, adjusted, on revenue of $13.4 billion at the midpoint, versus analyst expectations of 16 cents per share on $13.23 billion in sales.   Intel posted net income of $1.5 billion, or 35 cents per share, versus a net loss of $454 million, or a loss of 11 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.   Revenue fell 15% to $12.9 billion from $15.3 billion a year ago, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales.   Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts the company still sees persistent weakness in all segments of its business through year-end, and that server chip sales wont recover until the fourth quarter. He also said that cloud companies were focusing more on securing graphics processors for artificial intelligence instead of Intels central processors.   David Zinsner, Intels finance chief, said in a statement that part of the reason the report was stronger than expected was because of the progress the company has made toward slashing $3 billion in costs this year. Earlier this year, Intel slashed its dividend and announced plans to save $10 billion per year by 2025, including through layoffs.   We have now exited nine lines of business since Gelsinger rejoined the company, with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion, said Zinsner.   Revenue in Intels Client Computing group, which includes the companys laptop and desktop processor shipments, fell 12% to $6.8 billion. The overall PC market has been slumping for over a year. Intels server chip division, which is reported as Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 15% to $4 billion plus Intels Network and Edge division, which sells networking products for telecommunications, recorded a 38% decline in revenue to $1.4 billion.moreover Mobileye, a publicly traded Intel subsidiary focusing on self-driving cars, saw sales slip 1% on an annual basis to $454 million and Intel Foundry Services, the business that makes chips for other companies, reported $232 million in revenue.   Intels gross margin was nearly 40% on an adjusted basis, topping the companys previous forecast of 37.5%. Investors want to see gross margins expand even as the company invests heavily in manufacturing capability.   In the first quarter, the company posted its largest loss ever as the PC and server markets slumped and demand declined for its central processors. Intels results on Thursday beat the forecast that management gave for the second quarter at the time.   Intel management has said the turnaround will take time and that the company is aiming to match TSMCs chip-manufacturing prowess by 2026, which would enable it to bid to make the most advanced mobile processors for other companies, a strategy the company calls five nodes in four years. Intel said on Thursday that it remained on track to hit those goals.   Nvidia has had an amazing run, but any emerging technology, such as AI, which is bottlenecked by a single company will have issues in growth. Consulting firm McKinsey has pegged the AI market to be worth $1 trillion by 2030, but also that it was in an experimental and in early phases of commercial deployment.   While Nvidia will likely retain its leadership in GPU hardware as applied to AI for the foreseeable future, it is likely that other hardware solutions for AI systems will also be successful as AI matures. While technologist may quibble on specifics, all major AI hardware today are based on GPU architectures, and as such I will use the terms and concepts of AI hardware and GPU architecture somewhat interchangeably.   One likely candidate for AI related growth may be AMD (AMD), which has had GPU products since acquiring ATI in 2006.However, unlike Nvidia, which had a clear vision for of general-purpose GPU products (GPGPU), historically, AMD had largely kept its focus on the traditional gaming applications. AMD has developed an AI architecture called XDNA, and an AI accelerator called Alveo and announced its MI300, an integrated chip with GPU acceleration for high-performance computing and machine learning. How AMD can and may evolve in the AI may be subject of a different article.   Another contender for success in the AI applications using GPU is Intel, who is the focus of this article. Intel has maintained a consistent, if low key focus on GPU hardware focused on AI applications over the last decade. Intels integrated HD Graphics is built into most modern processor ICs; however, these are insufficient compared to dedicated GPUs for high-end inferencing or machine learning tasks.   It has 2 primary GPU architectures in production release:   In 2019 Intel Corporation acquired Habana Labs, an Israel-based developer of programmable deep learning accelerators for the data center for approximately $2 billion. Habana Labs Gaudi AI product line from its inception focused on AI deep learning processor technologies, rather than as GPU that has been extended to AI applications. As a result, Gaudi microarchitecture was designed from the start for the acceleration of training and inferencing. In 2022 Intel announced Gaudi2 and Greco processors for AI deep learning applications, implemented in 7-nanometer (TSMC) technology and manufactured on Habanas high-efficiency architecture. Habana Labs benchmarked Gaudi2s training throughput performance for the ResNet-50 computer vision model and the BERT natural language processing model delivering twice the training throughput over the Nvidia high end A100-80GB GPU. So, Gaudi appears to give Intel a competitive chip for AI applications.   Concurrent with the Habana Labs Gaudi development, Intel has internally developed the Xe GPU family, as dedicated graphics card to address high-end inferencing or machine learning tasks as well as more traditional high-end gaming. Iris Xe GPU family consists of a series of microarchitectures, ranging from integrated/low power (Xe-LP) to enthusiast/high performance gaming (Xe-HPG), data center/AI (Xe-HP) and high-performance computing (Xe-HPC). The architecture has been commercialized in Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series (formerly codenamed Arctic Sound) and Intel Arc GPU cards. There is some question on Xe GPU future and evolution. Intel has shown less commitment to the traditional GPU space compared to Gaudi. Nonetheless, it does demonstrate Intel ability to design and field complex GPU products as its business requires.   Intel has many other AI projects underway. The Sapphire Rapids chips implements AI specific acceleration blocks including technology called AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions), which provides acceleration inside the CPU for efficient matrix multiplications used in on-chip inferencing and machine learning processing by speeding up data movement and compression. Intel has supporting technologies such as Optane, which while cancelled as a production line, is available for their needs of a high-performance non-volatile memory, one of the intrinsic components in any AI product.   Based on the above, Intel appears to have competitive hardware solutions, however if we look at Nvidia success in AI, it is a result of a much a software and systems focus as it is the GPGPU hardware itself. Can Intel compete on that front. Ignoring for the moment that Intel has a huge software engineer (approx. 15,000) resource, it also has- access to one of the leading success stories in perhaps the most competitive AI application  self driving cars.   Mobileye, who was acquired by Intel in 2017, has been an early adopter and leader, with over 20 years of experience in automotive automated driving and vision systems. As such, Mobileye has a deep resource of AI domain information that should be relevant to many applications. Mobileye has announced that it is working closely with Habana, as related divisions within Intel. While Intel is in the process of re-spinning out Mobileye as public company, Mobileye Global Inc. (MBLY), at present Intel still owns over 95% of shares, keeping it effectively an Intel division.   In looking at Intel, we have a company with the history, resources, and technology to compete with Nvidia and infrastructure. They have made significant investment and commitment to the emerging AI market, in times when they have exited other profitable businesses. It should also be understood that AI related product are a small percentage of overall Intel revenues (INTC revenue are more than twice NVDA, even if NVDA has 6x its market cap), and continues to keep its primary business focus on its processor and foundry business.   Hopefully for shareholders, Intel continues to push their AI technology and business efforts. Their current position is that this is strategic, but Intel is in a very fluid time and priorities may change based on business, finances, and of course the general interest and enthusiasm for AI. It is always worth noting that AI as a technical concept is mature, and appears to be cyclical, with interest in the technical community rising and falling in hype and interest once every decade or so. I remember working on AI applications, at the time labeled as expert systems in the 1980s. If we are currently at a high hype point, this may be temporary, based on near term success and disappointment in what AI does achieve. Of course, as always, this time is different and the building blocks of effective AI systems currently exist, where for previous iterations, it was more speculative."
2023-10-14 13:07:09,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/MSFT/ZirVq5zD-Is-MSFT-Stock-A-Buy-Sell-or-Hold/,"MSFT is one of the few tech stocks which trades close to all-time highs, seemingly oblivious to the brutal valuation reset that swept through the sector   In the most recent quarter, MSFT delivered strong results when factoring in the tough macro environment. MSFT grew revenues by 7% (10% constant currency) and earnings per share by 10% (14% constant currency) - two achievements not necessarily typically seen under difficult economic circumstances.   MSFT generated $8.64 billion of that operating income from its productivity and business processes segment, which houses its Office 365 product suite among others. As to be expected, LinkedIn revenue growth came in light at just 8%, a reflection of lower hiring demand.   MSFT generated another $9.4 billion in operating income from its intelligent cloud segment. Azure grew at a 27% clip, far surpassing the 16% growth seen at competitor Amazon Web Services   Investors have been cautious on the ever-valuable cloud business ever since the cloud titans all revealed cloud optimization efforts undertaken by its customers. On the conference call, management implied that they may see easing headwinds as they pass the anniversary of those optimization efforts, stating that at some point, workloads just can't be optimized much further. It is possible that MSFTs partnership with ChatGPTs creator OpenAI has something to do with that, as management noted that while they do not consolidate any operating losses due to them holding a minority equity interest, they do indeed recognize revenues generated from OpenAI using their cloud services. The other cloud titans did not offer the same bullish commentary surrounding the end of cloud optimization.   MSFT continued to see headwinds from its more personal computing segment, which saw revenues decline by 9% though still managed to generate $4.24 billion in operating income. At some point the comps should become easier here, but that may still be a couple of quarters away.   MSFT ended the quarter with $104.5 billion in cash versus $48.2 billion in debt. I note that the company also has another $9.4 billion in equity investments (the announced $10 billion investment in OpenAI is set to take place in parts throughout the year).   The company continues to pay a growing dividend and conducted $5.5 billion in share repurchases in the quarter. It is not too often that one can get long term innovation and have the majority of free cash flow returned to shareholders as well.   Looking ahead, management has noted that overall growth may struggle due to the prior years quarter being a tough comp, with that being their largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large multiyear commitments. Management did, however, guide for up to 27% in Azure growth, which seems to imply that the bottom for that segment may be very near if not already passed. Investors may be worried about how ongoing tech layoffs may impact Office 365 growth, but management appeared unfazed by this risk, citing that they continue to see strong demand for their product suites.   MSFT continues to show why it is a favorite tech stock in growth allocations, as it has shown resilient growth in the face of tough macro. The strong fundamentals have helped the stock sustain a premium valuation multiple, as the stock recently traded hands at just under 35x earnings.   Valuation remains the most obvious risk with that stock trading something between 50% and 100% higher than GOOGL depending on how many adjustments applied to the latter. With the stock trading so richly on present earnings, the stock could go nowhere for 7-10 years and still be trading at around 15x earnings at that time. Unless MSFT manages to sustain double-digit earnings longer than consensus, the stock will likely need to sustain a rich multiple in order to beat the market index. I note that this risk does not appear as large at the aforementioned mega-cap peers due to not just lower valuations but also due to MSFT appearing to already be operationally efficient with operating margins in excess of 40%. Another risk is that of potential disruption to its enterprise tech business. Wall Street appears to view the stock as being the strongest operator in any of its competing markets, but I do not share such views. In particular, I view competition from the likes of CrowdStrike (CRWD),and GOOGLs productivity suite as being underestimated risks. It is possible that MSFT is about to face long- term disruption just as its growth story is decelerating - which would have a catastrophic impact on multiples. Due to the near term upside from OpenAI, MSFT hit ATH and now its in pullback mode, I took huge profit and waiting for more confirmation"

Chemical industry. Specialized chemicals.   I will say that I combined the   training idea with the trading one   , how the stocks will be relevant for trading now, the potential first profit with confirmation of support can be about   + 90%.   Everything that happens now, goals, read below under the description of the   manipulation of a short squeeze.   But let's plunge into the past and in order to examine this detective story in order to evaluate this masterpiece of trading art by applying the punishment of the zombie crowd of believers it should be like that and put sure Stop-Loss like a smart uncle wrote to us in a book.   It was like this ... It seems that the downtrend will last forever. After all, the price over the past 2 years has fallen by almost -99%! Dump from $ 245 to $ 3.30!   This is what happens with real companies, but what about non-existent crypto projects?   After all, almost all crypto projects are built on promises that this nothing will cost a lot. Buy and hold, and you and the plant employee will become a millionaire in a couple of months / years. The sweetest lie, the more willing poor John believes in it.   As you understand, in many cryptocurrency projects for lovers of buy and hold, to become a millionaire and stop going to the factory is still ahead.   It doesnt matter whether these assets are pumped up yet or not, but their ultimate fate is the complete disappearance in the near future of the life of poor believing John.   The graph shows a   strong downtrend   , merciless to investors. But among investors, one must not forget that there are very rich uncles who can also make a mistake. But those who want to fix it. Well, it is clear that after such a fall from $ 240 to $ 3, no sane person believes in growth already, how silly it is. Most traders enter only a short position.   But there are more intelligent people who have thought and decided why we dont make a lot of money on 100% faith of people.   The strongest downtrend. Drop from $ 240 to $ 3.30. Minus 99% for 2 years.   As part of this trend, many sellers are going to expect a continued decline in the trend.   But after all, everyone was taught that it is necessary to put Stop-Loss, and if you do not, then you should always close somewhere.   Where will everyone have stops on this chart? Yes, everything of course depends on the point of opening positions, but the generally accepted approach - Stop-Loss who enters a short position will be put for the nearest resistance, that is, we will be interested in the zones above the selected levels on the chart.   If everything is clear and the main crowd has so much faith and become accustomed to the eternal fall, why not take advantage of this and start the domino effect? After all, money is burned only initially to start the process, then only fantastic earnings. How everyone will be ""trapped"" in a trap. Any inadequate Stop-Loss sizes will be reached. Buy or margin Call.   Gevo inc. Levels where the crowd of ""shorts"" puts Stop-Loss.   It is in these zones that Stop-Loss of most market participants are behind the resistance.   Large players understand this very well, its a sin not to use it if you have enough money on hand for this manipulation.   Perhaps the biggest player is the company itself, which is very interested in getting out of a loss-making situation and making big profits. After all, having for this a certain amount of money you can start an avalanche-like process and get the most unattainable Stop-Loss, thereby moving the market up against the current trend on Stop-Loss. This is an avalanche-like process.   You understand very well what will happen to those traders who have opened a short trend and the price will begin to rise against their position, and even grow rapidly impulse with no chance of pardon. Yes, everything is simple, when we reach a certain zone, the order is executed, that is, the position is closed by Stop-Loss. And we all know that a position is closed by opening a reverse position, which means that if we were on sale, then a purchase is opened to close, that is, we create additional demand for growth. And so on the chain.   And its not scary that then the price will return very quickly back to the previous values, because the manipulators will be in big profit, and the trader who caught the margin will no longer enter a short position on this asset. This is what came out of the chart below.   Gevo inc. Growth + 600% at closing short on Stop-Loss.   As we can see, the first strong resistance was + 100% of the minimum value before the short squeeze.   That's how you think who believed that the price will reach these values? It is clear that no one, well, especially since the price will reach the last Stop Loos zone.   For such an action, money was needed only until the first Stop-Loss zone, after which the price moves according to the domino effect. Growth fuel is the closing of short positions. Virtually no one believed in growth, which is why the impulse was + 600%, due to the closure of short positions of those who did not believe.   After a while, the price broke the line of the main downtrend. Price shifted to lateral movement. Wishing to enter the short was less and less, as everyone remembered the previous margin Call.   A year ago, there were two more attempts to punish those wishing to enter a short position in this trading instrument. It was not possible to repeat the short squeeze situation on such a scale. The first short squeeze is + 67% and immediately after it + 27%.   It can be seen that there are no more willing traders to enter a short position on this trading instrument.   Gevo inc. The situation is now.   Please note that only on short-squeezes did a large volume go out at the auction.   Traders with short positions were squeezed out of the market specifically.   In lateral movement, the   price is now drawing a formation that could become a triple bottom.   If support is   confirmed   , the growth potential to the previous   local maximum and the first resistance is about + 90%.   ___________________________________________   Manipulations.   Someone thinks that manipulations occur only in the crypto market, this is not so, they are everywhere, only in the crypto market they are open and arrogant, as there is no responsibility for this.   In other markets, there is price manipulation, but to a lesser extent, as if the relevant authorities prove guilty there will be huge fines, or the deprivation of a license for trading activities up to the prison.   ___________________________________________   What is a squeeze on the exchange. Short squeeze. Long squeeze.   Squeeze   (eng. Queeze - squeeze out) - a situation in the financial market when Stop Loss is sharply collected. As a result of the sharp increase, part of the Stop Loss is squeezed out, and part is closed at the what is price, this leads to an even greater increase / decrease in the price.   Since positions can be held both in purchase and in sale, both short-squeeze and long-squeeze are possible.   Short squeeze   - it happens when sellers (shorts) are forced to close their open positions in order to avoid even greater losses, which only spurs the price even higher. On the graph, the hairpin (shadow) is up.   Long squeeze   - exactly the opposite. A sharp decline in the price of assets, forcing buyers (longists) to close their positions. Here, the buyers are already the victims, who are forced to close open transactions at a loss in order to prevent even greater losses, which provokes a further drop in the price of the instrument. On the graph, the hairpin (shadow) is down.   ________________________________________   Short squeeze on margin trading.   If it comes to margin trading, the strongest buyer today is yesterday's short. The vicious circle for bears is called ""short squeeze"" - short squeeze. In order not to be trapped, market participants must understand the principle of short positions, see the potential for a situation that could provoke a short squeeze. Experienced traders know how to make a profit with a short squeeze.   The strongest short-term growth waves often occur during periods when a large number of lower players find themselves locked in an unprofitable position due to an unexpected price increase for them. As a rule, these are mid-level traders and so-called hamsters market participants with a level of knowledge and experience that is close to zero and close to it. Unfortunately or vice versa, fortunately the bulk of the crowd of the crypto market is precisely this layer of society. In such a situation, in order to get out of the trap they have to actively buy this cryptocurrency in which they are locked at any price in order to save part of their capital and fix the loss. I will explain in more detail so that the mechanism of this phenomenon becomes more clear.   A short position or short-term transaction (from impudent short) is an operation when a trader sells a borrowed coin with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. After the return of the borrowed coins, the difference between the sale price and the purchase price becomes profit.   You can borrow cryptocurrency from the exchange, which as a guarantee for such a loan requires an adequate amount of guarantee security in the account. As a guarantee, money, bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, which are valued at a certain discount, can act.   When the value of the coin in which you are in a position increases, the size of the required guarantee for short positions also begins to grow rapidly. If the amount of funds in the account is insufficient to cover the required amount of security, the exchange may forcefully close the position.   Downgrade players usually try to prevent this situation and close the position before submitting a margin call request from the exchange. However, their tactics here are essentially the same - a quick purchase of a coin that has grown in price, and you are in a short unprofitable position on it. If the size of the positions of such participants is large enough, then this situation can lead to skyrocketing prices and the avalanche-like closure of other shorts.   Scalper traders and intraday traders who often open counter-trend trades in the hope of a pullback after active growth can aggravate the situation even more. If the rollback is not realized, then their purchases may become additional fuel for the upward movement.   ________________________________   The immaturity of the cryptocurrency market provides opportunities for manipulation.   An important feature of the cryptocurrency market, which is often ignored, is its tendency to respond to the actions of individual bidders. By individual bidders, I mean large traders, the creators of individual cryptocurrencies on which manipulations occur, as well as exchanges, which naturally themselves are owners of large cryptocurrency assets. And also, if desired, can affect their price. Roughly speaking, these are market participants who are called whales in the slang of traders.   The cryptocurrency market is more affected by the influence of these particular market participants than other markets, due to the lack of maturity and insufficient control of the relevant state financial control bodies.   No fundamental does not work without money support, but money on the exchange without the influence of the fundamental works in such an uncontrolled market perfectly. For example, we are all familiar with such frequent phenomena in the crypto market as ""pumps"" (artificially pumping prices). Very often they occur even without the release of FUD news on a particular coin.   Also, the entire crypto market is very much tied to the dynamics of bitcoin, which can lead it in the opposite direction to fundamental factors.   In recent years, the market has become more mature: instead of the buy-and-hold trading strategy, many have begun to use more advanced methods. Futures contracts, trading with leverage, opening short positions are now available. The more powerful players appear in the industry, the more the community takes on them tricks from the field of trading.   More and more traders are using short positions in a falling market, allowing them to earn money in such conditions. And naturally, in such conditions, short squids and long squises often occur. Since the majority of traders take short positions in the bear market, many receive big losses, some especially greedy and not experienced margin calls.   Large investors can begin to behave dishonestly Short-squeeze can be carried out only by a large market participant, such manipulations are beyond the power of ordinary traders. How to do this you need a huge amount. As a rule, such manipulations are done by the exchanges themselves. This is illegal - but everything is legal on the cryptocurrency market!   There are conspiracy theories that such manipulations are carried out by exchanges, thus getting rid of customers who will definitely be in the black due to short positions and withdraw money from the exchange ecosystem."

However, even though the fundamentals are all green, there may be a ""Black Swan"" nestling within Mountainview society, this black swan might even have the face of the Department of Justice. Indeed, for several days, judges have been digging into the past to find out whether Google would not have abused and used financial manipulation to obtain this dominant position in search engines.   Whether we subscribe to this conspiracy theory or not, we cannot neglect the fact that the government will want to make an example and deprive Google of its current privileges - such as, for example, being the default search engine at Apple - this hypothesis could even justify the probability of a severe correction, even if, in the long term, it should not have too much impact either.

2023-10-14 09:01:12,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/voWrD9UK-Tesla-TSLA-A-Promising-but-Cautious-Outlook/,"Tesla (TSLA) has been navigating the market with an air of resilience, showcasing elements of both bullish and bearish sentiments, but maintaining an overall neutral stance in the short term. In the medium term, the outlook remains positive, instilling confidence among investors. Let's delve deeper into the dynamics of TSLA and what to expect.   A Market Overview   As TSLA stands as part of the Automobiles industry, it finds itself in the company of 38 other stocks. Impressively, TSLA is outpacing 81% of its industry peers, indicating its competitive edge within this sector. However, it's essential to remember that TSLA's performance is often aligned with industry trends.   52-Week Range Comparison   Currently, TSLA is trading comfortably within the upper portion of its 52-week range. Simultaneously, the S&P 500 Index, the barometer for the broader market, is also trading in a similar upper range. This alignment suggests that TSLA's performance is relatively in line with the overall market, reflecting a sense of stability.   Trading Volume Confidence   With an average trading volume of 116,000,000 shares per day, TSLA exhibits liquidity, a reassuring sign for investors. A liquid stock tends to offer flexibility and minimizes the risk of significant price swings due to low trading activity.   Performance Metrics   When we scrutinize TSLA's yearly performance compared to the broader market, it emerges as one of the top performers, outperforming 73% of all stocks. It's worth noting that this performance is primarily attributed to a robust surge that occurred approximately four months ago. Investors should consider this context when evaluating TSLA's long-term prospects.   In the technical realm, TSLA presents a promising setup pattern. Recent price action indicates consolidation, accompanied by a reduction in volatility. Currently, a pullback is unfolding, offering a potential entry point for astute investors. This setup warrants attention, as it might herald a compelling opportunity.   Additionally, it's worth noting that the Strongest Trendline indicator in the daily chart suggests a bullish trend, albeit with a moderate confidence level. This nuanced insight underscores the need for cautious optimism.   In conclusion, Tesla (TSLA) straddles the line between bullish and bearish sentiments in the short term, ultimately settling in a neutral stance. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, buoyed by its resilient performance in the Automobiles industry. With a healthy trading volume and a promising technical setup, investors have reason to be cautiously optimistic about TSLA's future prospects. Nevertheless, it's crucial to monitor its performance closely, especially given the stock's recent strong performance."

The gap has not been completely filled. When a gap is not filled in a downtrend, it is a sign of weakness. AMZN is also not able to break above 50 SMA, which is hovering in the area of the gap.   When AMZN reached 123 on 28 September, it was testing 38.2% retracement of the 1-2-3-4-5 Motive Wave. This level was retested on 6 October. However, AMZN is showing signs of weakness since, as I said, it is unable to fill the gap so far. If AMZN goes down to the 38.2 percent level again and bounces, it may fill the gap and continue upwards. However, I think this is a less likely scenario since we are in a weak market.   The more likely scenario: AMZN is forming an A-B-C Corrective Wave. AMZN will lose the 38.2 percent retracement and retrace up to 115, which is the 50 percent retracement level of the 1-2-3-4-5 Motive Wave. The C Wave will be completed here. There is also strong support at this level - the peak of 2 Feb 2023.   The uptrend that will begin at 115 will go up to 155, which is the 61.8 percent projection level of the large Motive Wave (taking the low as 115 - end of A-B-C Corrective Wave)."

Well, the reversal persisted until $177 but fell short of the $180 target area, influenced by the outbreak of a war over the weekend and slightly hotter than expected CPI.

I would not be buying here at this level unless it breaks the 100$ level and manages to hold it as support. It is almost overbought on the 4h00 so it would make sense for it to take a breather before trying to break the 100$ level which recently became resistance.   I will be buying shares of Alibaba upon bullish retest of the top channel at around 83-86$ (the yellow circle). First TP at 100$ and second one at 125$ and then 160-162$ for the gap fill.   To give a little extra perspective on why I'm taking this trade:   The Hang seng index (HSI) is also sitting close to very long term support trend line right now. China isn't going to let their tech sector crash and lose the long term support trend line as we saw a couple of months ago. As soon as that came close to happening during what seems like capitulation selling volume (on march 16th) the CCP started talking about easing regulations and then index moved from 18k to 22k almost instantly. So yeah, just like the FED, the CCP can decide to help the markets when they see key levels being breached. They understand the importance of economic growth and capital inflows.   For longer term swing trades I would look at the 200$ or 215$ levels to take some profits as well.   Good luck with your trades guys"

2023-10-13 19:03:34,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/qw8dRAeQ-TradingView-Masterclass-How-To-Use-Drawing-Tools/,"We continue with our Masterclass series, which we created to teach people how to get started with charting, research, and analysis. In this lesson, youll learn all about the Drawing Panel located on the left side of your chart. Lets get started!   Drawing tools    There are eight categories in the drawing tool section: Cursors, Trend line tools, Fibonacci tools, Patterns, Forecasting and measurement tools, Geometric shapes, Annotation tools, and Icons. In addition, just below these categories, there are handy features that augment and optimize your research in specific situations, such as zooming in/out, measuring, and a magnet tool for selecting specific price points. Lets analyze each of these in detail:   - Cursors: Located at the very top corner of the drawing tool section, Cursors gives you the capability to change your mouse as you move around the chart. For example, we have other variations such as the dot cursor or the simplest of all, the arrow cursor. Finally, we have an eraser tool to remove objects from the chart by clicking on them.   - Trend lines: Trend lines can be used to identify and visualize the direction of a price trend, and are sometimes used for drawing support or resistance lines as well. In this section, you can also find trend channels and pitchforks.   - Gann and Fibonacci tools: These advanced tools are often used by technical analysts and quants to locate retracements, pullbacks, measured moves, and advanced price sequences. The Fibonacci tools include retracement, extension, fans, arcs, and more. The Gann tools include box, square, and fan.   - Patterns: In this section, youll find popular drawing tools for mapping our complex patterns that require several different points to be drawn such as Elliott waves, head and shoulders, and impulses.   - Forecasting and measurement tools: These invaluable tools are used to make projections either long or short, study specific stats such as time or price ranges, and also give you the capability to analyze volume with VWAP and volume profiles.   - Geometric shapes: These tools are where you can find the brush tool to freely draw on your chart, but it also goes deeper than that, as there are also important shapes whereby a trader can highlight important areas on the chart with a rectangle or arrow such as accumulation or historical rebound zones.   - Annotation tools: These can be used to write notes, reminders, prices, and journal entries. These are key tools for traders who want to track their progress over time and always have specific notes attached to the chart. It also includes the ability to insert X links and images from your computer.   - Icons: Need a little more color or character on your chart? This section gives you hundreds of emojis, icons, and stickers to add to your chart. Highlight an area, add more art to your chart or spice up your creativity.   Tip: Keyboard shortcuts    Did you know that you can use keyboard shortcuts for the most popular drawing tools? To find out the command, you need to open the drop-down menu of one of the 8 drawing tool categories and you will see the command on the right side of some tools. For example:   Alt + T = Trendline   Alt + F = Fib retracement   Alt + H = Horizontal line   Alt + V = Vertical line   Alt + I = Invert chart   Alt + W = Add current symbol to watchlist   If you're a Mac user, use  instead of Alt.   Measure and zoom    When you use the Measure tool (the ruler icon just below the 8 drawing tool category icons), you can see at a glance how much an asset has fallen or risen in numbers, percentages, bars and days. Combined with the Zoom tool (the magnifying glass with +/- icons), you can also focus on the most important areas of the chart. For both measuring and zooming, the procedure is the same: select the tool, click on the point where you want to start measuring or from where you want to zoom, and end with another click where you want to end. You can also use the ""Shift"" hotkey instead of the icon. To remove a measurement, simply click on the chart.   Magnet mode    Magnet mode is a wizard that helps you to bring the drawing tools closer to the nearest price bars that you hover over with the mouse. There are 2 modes: Weak magnet and Strong magnet. This tool allows traders to perfectly connect a drawing tool to a specific price point. The current values are OHLC, meaning when Magnet mode is turned on, all drawing tools will connect to the nearest open, high, low or close value. Want to draw support lines that always connect to a specific price? Use this tool.   Stay in drawing mode    If you are going to make several drawings on the chart at the same time, you may find it useful to activate this option (pencil + padlock icon), as it will allow you to make as many drawings as you want without deactivating the selected drawing tool. Remember that you must deactivate this option to return to normal mode.   Lock all drawing tools    Once the chart has been configured, if you do not want to make any further changes, you can lock everything that has been drawn with this option (padlock icon) so that you do not accidentally delete elements in the future.   Hide/Show drawings/indicators/positions & orders    This option allows you to toggle the visibility of the drawings, indicators, positions & orders or even all three to make comparisons with a blank chart. The keyboard shortcut is ""Ctrl + Alt + H"".   Drawing sync    This allows you to synchronize the drawings of the selected charts in the current layout or in all layouts (globally). Youll surely want to test this feature as its perfect for those who perform multi-timeframe technical analysis and research across multiple charts or timeframes. For example, when this tool is turned on, if you draw on one chart, all of your drawings will appear on your other charts that have the same symbol.   Delete objects    With a single click, you can delete all drawings or indicators, or even both at the same time. There are also a few other options to remove specific things on your chart. Use this tool wisely and dont accidentally delete everything!   Show favorite drawing tools toolbar    To set up the favorites toolbar, first, you must first go to one of the eight drawing categories and click on the gray star in one of the tools. When you click on it, it turns orange and the quick access toolbar for drawing tools is created. Once you have selected all your favorites, move the favorites toolbar around so that you can use it conveniently every time you want to draw something on the charts.   Thats a wrap! We hope you found this guide valuable. We'd love to hear about your favorite drawing tool, so please share your thoughts in the comments below. Additionally, if you have any feedback or suggestions, drop us a line.   - TradingView Team"

The price structure* on weekly time-frame suggests there is a high chance that SLV, has found its bottom last year in Sep'22 and with higher low this year in Oct'23.   As long as Oct low holds, I would expect the price to move toward next resistance zones: first 22 and later important 24-25 zone. Afterwards, if price builds a handle and breaks-out above 24 that would confirm the move to 27-30-32 resistance area.   Overall, traditional fear-type assets look mid to long-term bullish to my eyes in coming months and years.   Trading thesis   : I need the price to confidently move above 50D MA, and create at least short base with several days/a week of consolidation around previous basing attempts (most recent being around 21) with later break-out above this pivot to consider longs.   * Important caveat to EW: I use it solely to have a subjective idea about sentiment and overall structural context to support, but not guide, my investing decisions.

2023-10-13 18:28:40,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/CVX/iqvIPkf6-CVX-swing-long/,"I am becoming bullish on energy stocks, in particular CVX.   First my technical rationale:   CVX has consilidated over the past 3+ months in an unusually tight range. On Friday, the stock ended exactly on the POC for the trailing 3 months.   Despite a number of headwinds (see below) CVX remains in the context of an uptrend.   CVX and XLE (the ETF it is most closely correlated to) have under-performed the broader market over the longer term, but have shows strength more recently, pointing to the possibility of favorable sector rotation.   None of the three downward thrusts that occurred over the past month have uncovered significant supply at lower prices   A rise above 164 would present an entry on the double/triple bottom pattern that emerged over the past month, suggesting further potential towards 171+.   From a fundamental perspective:   Crude oil futures remained quite resilient despite the ongoing dollar strength over the past number of weeks, along with widely reported economic weakness reported out of China.   US rig counts have peaked late last year and started to decline significantly over the past six months. This should provide further support for oil prices.   Year-on-year realized price comparisons were very challenging during the first half of the year, but that headwind looks set to die down.   CVX is a high quality stock, with a rare, perfect Piotroski Score of 9, a substantial dividend, trading at a reasonable 11.3x 2024 EPS. Given all the macro uncertainty, this should help maintain demand for the stock.   I see two stages to this opportunity. In the shorter term, I expect a return to the highs of the trailing one month range. For this, my stop loss will be a closing violation of the ascending channel, while my PT is 164. On a longer time scale I see CVX return above 170, though that might not happen before the earnings release in early November."

However, we cannot ignore what the market is saying about it either.   We already know for a while now that OPEC cut oil production due to a lack of demand globally. We also know that oil prices spiked due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.   The US countered that spike in prices by using oil reserves and pumping up production to new all-time highs.   We know Europe is in stagflation while Asia (China) is in a recession.   Lastly, we know that massive amounts of deficits worldwide have been backstopping world markets from reflecting that weakness.

2023-10-13 17:29:01,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/TSLA/oBCyBwm9-Tesla-Update-POSSIBLE-GAP-DOWN-TOMORROW/,"All right y'all let's get into this. The pattern that Tesla has been carving out has been dubious to say the least. Constant overlap with the appearance of 5 wave moves just to turn out as another corrective wave. To say this type of price action is frustrating is an understatement, but as my mentor often says, ""Trading for profit is hard"". If it was easy everyone would do it.   I'm sure many are wondering about the title, and yes, I do believe there is a high probability we open with a gap down tomorrow. The primary reason is where we are in the count and where the index's are in their count. The NASDAQ for instance, has ALOT of catching up to do with the S&P if their respected counts are to stay similar.  As of now Tesla looks like it needs 2-3 more lows to finish this micro 5 wave count. I expect us to drop to around the 0.382 in the low $250's - high $240's before we retrace for a minor 2 (could be tiny or big...it's a wave 2). Then BOOM, wave 3 of 3 starts and that target is $211.65 down to the 1.618 @ $203.17. Ultimately this thing could just absolutely tank with an extremely tiny wave 2.   So far bulls have been stubborn and don't want to admit defeat. However, the facts are starting to pile up against them and they are starting to falter. This is evident in the MACD as this whole move up from the $234 bottom has been on neg div. & choppy/overlapping as hell. When they finally give up and start to sell it will be swift giving little room for entry.   Before you take any sizable position though wait for confirmation we're headed lower. Below $251 and we have that confirmation, not that we are dropping hard but that we are in fact back in the down trend and wave (2) is finally over. This just so happens to line up with our wave 1 of (3) of C target and a very likely place for me to sell my puts before the small retrace. If we are moving down with great strength, there is a chance I hold through the retrace for 3 of (3) but we will just have to see what kind of action we are getting.   The chart above shows that we tagged the 1.382 fib extension, tagged the 0.786 fib retracement, and broke the lower channel. These are good signs we have topped but aren't guarantees. On the micro level, it looks like a 1-2, 1-2 are in place and working on extending out in a three now. This is where breaching $251 will make things much clearer (but when is Tesla ever that nice to us). The 2.618 for this micro move down is just above the 0.382 mentioned previously and the 2.786 is right on it creating fib confluence and helping to corroborate this thesis (2.618 is a common ending for this type of extension).   At this juncture though, I just don't see ANY bullish structures to take us higher, which is another reason why I have had no issues holding these puts. That and they make up a very small % of my portfolio. If y'all are nervous from the time you place an order to the time you exit it, you're either trading on a whim (extremely dangerous) or you're trading with outsized positions. THIS WILL AFFECT YOUR DECISION MAKING! Don't do it lol. Use stops and protect yourselves. Have a plan for entry AND exit. Otherwise, you're going in all halfcocked and that has never been good for anyone.   Bonam Fortunam,   --Tyler"

As long as 168 holds, I would expect the price to move towards next important resistance area 194-200 area. Ideally build a hand of the cup after reaching that level and break-out above 194 towards important next targets: 212-224-230.   Also notice the ""Mona Lisa"" of  cup-and-handle pattern in GLD on a monthly time-scale   The symmetry and volume dynamics, that subsides in the handle area, is almost picture perfect.   Trading thesis   : I will be looking for price to digest its rally from Oct lows, preferably around 177-180 area, creating a cheat pivot and relatively low risk entry point.

There are a few major considerations that I have when viewing differences in certain charts that almost contradict some of the ideas I may have for upcoming trades.   One thing at the back of my mind has me thinking that the bottom of the market has not been seen just yet, and we will likely retest the pre - covid level on the SPY / SPX before moving higher.   However, if we take a look at charts such as TQQQ and SQQQ, we can see that these ETF's have already seen a massive collapse and broken through pre-covid levels, inevitably finding support at a weekly trend line before making its way back up while respecting current fib levels.   Additionally, SQQQ has seen the lowest price to date without the market reaching an all time high. Are these potentially giving us a hint to where the market may move?   On the long term, I am leaning more bullish unless we see some kind of Black Swan event that will trigger a fast flush , and potentially even enough to change the course of the FED policy before we see the larger move for the next business cycle."

2023-10-13 14:07:58,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/META/I9z8QXAV-Meta-Platforms-Revives-in-2023-with-Impressive-Gains/,"Meta Platforms Revives in 2023 with Impressive Gains   After a lackluster performance in 2022, Meta Platforms, previously known as Facebook, has made a remarkable comeback in 2023. The company's shares have surged by approximately 162%, a stark contrast to the previous year when the stock saw a decline of over 64%. These gains are over 13 times the returns of the S&P 500, demonstrating the magnitude of Meta's resurgence.   The primary driving force behind Meta's 2023 success is its return to revenue growth after several quarters of decline. Additionally, Meta Platforms has harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI), which holds promising implications for its future.   Investors who remained on the sidelines during Meta's resurgence now face a crucial decision. They must weigh the allure of potential further gains against concerns about the stock's high valuation and the uncertainties within the digital advertising industry. Let's delve deeper into this conundrum.   The economic challenges that dominated the headlines in the previous year took a toll on many companies, and Meta Platforms was no exception. In times of economic uncertainty, marketers often cut back on advertising spending, which can be quickly adjusted. Meta Platforms, as a company heavily reliant on digital advertising across its social media platforms and the world's second-largest online advertiser, with a 20% market share, felt the brunt of this impact.   While most technology companies faced challenges during this period, the decline in ad spending led Meta to report three consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines, a first in its history. Understandably, investors grew concerned, and the most risk-averse among them chose to exit the stock. However, as it turns out, their cautious approach proved costly as Meta Platforms made a strong comeback this year. The rebound in digital advertising has fueled significant gains for investors.   Yet, it's important to note that this recovery is still in its early stages. In the second quarter of the year, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year growth in revenue and a 21% increase in earnings per share, positioning the company for potential record-high sales and profits.   What sets Meta apart is its commitment to embracing cutting-edge technology, particularly Generative AI. While AI has been integral to the company for various purposes, it now plans to apply these advanced algorithms to enhance its digital advertising efforts. Meta is one of the few companies with the resources required to develop large language models for generative AI.   In a recent move, Meta introduced a suite of AI-powered marketing tools for businesses advertising on its platforms. These tools allow for customized images and text, empowering businesses to target their desired audiences more effectively. AI plays a crucial role in creating backgrounds, adjusting aspect ratios, and generating multiple ad versions tailored to various advertising channels.   While many companies view the widespread adoption of AI as a future endeavor, Meta is already leveraging this technology to drive its growth.   However, Meta's stock is currently trading at 37 times its trailing 12-month earnings and roughly 7 times its sales, making it less of a bargain for investors. This somewhat inflated valuation may warrant caution.   Nonetheless, when you consider Meta's future prospects, the outlook becomes more favorable. It's valued at only 24 times next year's earnings and 5 times next year's sales, which is significantly more attractive. Why? Because the company is expected to return to double-digit growth in sales and earnings per share by the end of 2024.   The recovery in the digital advertising market is well underway, and Meta is generously offering its AI expertise to advertisers at no cost, potentially attracting a growing number of them to its platform.   Despite the potential for market volatility due to ongoing economic uncertainties, investing in Meta Platforms now could prove to be a savvy move in five or ten years, especially given the extensive growth prospects on the horizon."

2023-10-13 13:14:44,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/chart/AMZN/V4woIlfo-HOW-TO-explain-my-decision-making-system/,"In the 21st century, financial and information technologies have reached such a level that we have an absolutely barrier-free environment for making investment decisions in the stock market. Brazilian investor does not need to live in the USA to buy shares of American companies. No need to be on a phone call with a broker or sit at a computer to make a stock market transaction - simply having a smartphone and internet access is sufficient. Market data, news, and financial reporting - all are becoming more accessible, striving for absolute transparency for the private investor.   Technologies have significantly simplified access to the market; however, they have not revolutionized its comprehension. I believe that future generations will also wrestle with what to invest in, even with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, I am confident that stock investors will always grapple with three questions:   - which stocks to choose?   - at what price to buy them?   - and in what volume?   I have designed my decision-making process, which can be represented as a crystal, to answer these three questions.   Imagine that the light penetrating the crystal represents the initial information about the company, contained in its financial reports, news, and market quotes. Algorithms and stock analysis principles work inside the crystal, processing the collected data and emitting it in a new format (*). Thus, the light reflected by the crystal, forms already new, derived information, convenient for processing by the investor.   (*) If you have not read my previous posts, I strongly recommend reviewing them to understand the algorithms and principles discussed.   Each facet of this imaginary crystal helps to examine the studied company from various perspectives and ultimately answer the three questions posed.   There are only 5 of these sides (facets):   1.   Fundamental Strength   2. Cash Flow dynamics   3. News   4. P/E ratio   5.   Rainbow Indicator   Thus, in my work, I utilize the principle of transforming complex information into a convenient visual format. This approach can be described as   visual analysis   of stocks based on fundamental data. If 90% of the information about the surrounding world originates from our vision, why not leverage our wonderful and clear eyes to answer the top three investor questions?   Now, let's take our crystal in hand and get started!   Question 1: which stocks to choose?   This question plagues any investor. After all, the US stock market itself trades thousands of companies' shares. To answer this, I will need to examine three facets (Fundamental Strength, Cash Flow Dynamics, News) of each company. Believe me, studying each one is not an easy feat, even while employing visual analysis tools.   To simplify the task for myself, I apply the concept I developed in my description of the Fundamental Strength Indicator:   My business valuation model is more suitable for companies engaged in the production of goods or services, where tangible assets play a substantial role in the business.   This is due to the set of financial ratios I utilize in my model (*).   (*) Learn more about this in the article:   What can financial ratios tell us?   For example, I am unlikely to assess the operations of banks, financial institutions, and insurance firms using the Fundamental Strength Indicator. The activities of these corporations depend only slightly on their physical assets. Due to this, some of the ratios I utilize in the Fundamental Strength Indicator, such as ""Inventory to Revenue,"" are inapplicable. Additionally, there are cases when the actions of one ordinary employee of a financial organization threaten the existence of the company itself. It suffices to recall the story of trader Nick Leeson, who successfully bankrupted his employer - the English 'Barings Bank'.   An organization that makes use of tangible assets is the perfect potential company in my opinion. For instance, a microchip or nut manufacturer, a wholesale store, or a raw material supplier. In general, those who trade in tangible objects.   Let's take a look at the companies that align well or poorly with the above thesis. For this purpose, I shall employ TradingView's   Stock Screener   service. The screener allows me to see a list of companies that satisfy particular criteria (filter). For instance, I can choose businesses whose stock is listed on the US exchanges.   Or companies from the sector I have selected. A sector refers to a broad category of economic activity in which a company operates. For instance, businesses like The Coca-Cola Company, Nike Inc., and Colgate-Palmolive Company are included in the ""Consumer Non-Durables"" sector. They manufacture fast-moving consumer goods.   Thus, to avoid checking each company for compliance with the thesis, I filter at the sector level. I classify sectors into different tiers of groupings in my decision-making process.   The first-tier sector group consists of sectors that I prioritize and review first.   The second-tier sector group includes sectors that I review in the second order if I do not find sufficiently fundamentally strong companies in the first-tier sector group.   The third-tier sector group includes sectors that I review in the third order if I do not find sufficiently fundamentally strong companies in the second-tier sector group. The Fundamental Strength Indicator for this category of companies frequently indicates a dearth of the data needed for calculation. This is due to the specific nature of the company's operations.   So let's take a look at the groups of sectors of different tiers using the example of the US stock market (Filters: Market - US, Country of incorporation - US, Sector - selectable).   Given the size of the American stock market, I use another filter - ""Capitalization"", to eliminate very small companies. I look at companies with a capitalization of $ 1 billion or more. However, everyone can set this threshold for themselves independently.   Now, I can create a 'Watch List' for each sector, specifying which group it belongs to. For example: 'Retail Trade - tier 1'.  In this way, I can add the entire sector at once rather than adding each company's ticker to the Watch List individually. To do this, I download a sample of companies obtained in the Stock Screener and upload it to the Watch List.   Next, I add the   Fundamental Strength Indicator   twice to have two indicator panels. In the first panel, I will see the histogram and the blue line (Fundamental Strength). In the second - the Cash Flow dynamics.   Switching between tickers and analyzing the latest value of the blue line, I select companies with a Fundamental Strength equal to 8 and above. Such companies are moved to a specially created section within the Watch List - 'Fundamentally Strong Companies.' The arrangement of companies within this section will depend on their Cash Flows (*). The better the cash flow picture for me, the higher I will position the company in this section.   (*) Learn more about the Fundamental Strength Indicator and Cash Flows here:   HOW-TO evaluate the state of a company's cash flows?   To keep track of companies close to fundamental strength, I use another section in my Watch List - Candidates. Companies that have recently lost their fundamental strength can also be included there.   Moreover, I mark fundamentally strong companies with a green marker and candidates with an orange one. This allows me to avoid switching between Watch Lists and, for example, see all companies marked in green.   So, using the Screener and the Watch List, I create a database of companies segmented by sector. Next, I apply the Fundamental Strength Indicator to categorize the companies within the Watch List. The strongest companies are listed first on the Watch List, followed by the candidates, and then everyone else.   This sequence of actions allows me to evaluate two facets of my magic crystal - Fundamental Strength and Company Cash Flow. However, this is not all that will help me answer the question - Which stocks to choose? Because there is a facet that can make me doubt even if you have the most fundamentally strong company in front of you, with perfect cash flows. But that will be covered in the upcoming post. See you!"

I am following it a while, was a nice short on the way down. Finally posted a tiny bit more positive earnings compared to expectation.   Meanwhile a falling wedge formation created. Also moving in a big downward channel. There are two scenarios for counting the waves, one scenario suggests, that the wave 5 down could be finished (1.618 extension was put in a few days ago), and we are up for at least an A-B-C upside correction.   Possibly (but not guaranteed) we just starting to put in the Wave ""A"", so far.   Consodilation in a smaller channel happening, with one breakout to the top,which could fall back. Important thing in order to have this idea a basis, is not to put in a new low (0.7252), and not to stay below comfortably 0.78. If that happens, then I need to assume new lows are coming.   It is possible, that this 0.78 level will be retested, I am following SUNW's actions now more closely.   On the daily, RSI is started to come up a bit, trying to leave the oversold levels. MACD coming up, a little bit week still.   The 9/15 SMA's starting to turn updwards, currently being a possible support. 21day EMA so far rejecting price actions, so we are squeezed in between those.   52day EMA/180 EMA, 200SMA coming down, 52 in a higher speed.   On the weekly, 200 SMA up at around 3.92; it is far away (to be a resistance)   Weekly RSI is on oversold levels (could drop more of course), trying to leave it, now showing sign of possible normalization,   MACD indicator could start to converge (in a few weeks could be divergenced, but no guarantee)   I have opened a long position( accumulation purposes), regardless of this idea.   I plan to open an other one for swing-trading, IF we restest the 0.78 fib level and popping back up from that (meaning possible wave 3 starting to the upside, and wave 2 is in)   Also be aware, as of now, the 1st quarter 2023 results,conference call and webcast was postponed, which might heavily influence the price actions (and sure it has a reason behind it.)

The deal was blocked in April by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which said it could give the U.S. computing giant a stranglehold over the nascent cloud gaming market.   But the regulator ripped up its play book by reopening the case after Microsoft agreed to sell the streaming rights to Activision's games to Ubisoft Entertainment, with remedies to ensure the terms were enforceable.   The deal was the biggest test of the CMA's global power to take on the tech giants since Britain left the European Union.   It said ""sticking to its guns"" in the face of criticism from the merging companies had delivered an outcome that was better for competition, consumers and economic growth.   The approval paves the way for Microsoft to close the deal by Oct. 18 after it extended the deadline to secure UK approval.   The CMA said Microsoft's concession on streaming was a ""gamechanger"", adding that it was the only competition agency globally to have delivered this outcome.   The new deal will stop Microsoft from locking up competition in cloud gaming as this market takes off, preserving competitive prices and services for UK cloud gaming customers,"" it said in a statement.   Microsoft announced the deal in early 2022, aiming to boost its growth in console, mobile, PC, and cloud gaming to compete with the likes of Tencent as well as PlayStation-owner Sony (NYSE:SONY).   The U.S. Federal Trade Commission opposed the deal but after failing to stop it, the CMA was left standing alone."

Founded in 1930, TXN has evolved into a global leader in the semiconductor industry, with a diverse portfolio of analog and embedded processing products. Here are some key aspects of the company:   Product Range:   TXN specializes in analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Analog chips are designed to process real-world signals such as sound, light, temperature, and motion. They are used in a wide range of applications, from industrial and automotive systems to consumer electronics.   As tensions between Taiwan and China continue to rise, it is a good idea to consider the semiconductor business as an industry to invest in. The largest chip manufacturer in Taiwan by far is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). Although TSMC focuses on digital semiconductors, the hype alone could lead many investors to add TXN to their portfolio simply because they don't understand the difference. TXN is also in a unique position, where in the event of a China-Taiwan conflict, it could certainly garner increased government funding.

All this price action taking place in less than 2 weeks, which indicates considerable market movement.   Amidst of all that, it broke below the 1M MA100 (green trend-line) for the first time since the COVID crash (March 2020). If it manages to close the month above it, it will be a strong statement towards all direction that the sector considers this level a Support and possibly the end of the Inflation Crisis.   Watch closely and you will see that this and the COVID crises are connected with a Higher Highs trend-line, similar to how the DotCom and Housing crises where in the 2000s. Technically this is a straight Higher Highs trend-line that connects all Highs and places the last 21 years of market into a Mega Rising Wedge pattern.   The 1M RSI is on a Lower Lows trend-line, which indicates a natural deceleration of the trend but as long as it holds, it sustains it. And right now it is exactly on that trend-line.

Monster Beverage Corporation   1. Price Formation: The price has previously broken out from a Reverse inverted Cup &Handle price formation on a daily chart and hit a target. Bearish sentiment.   2. Moving Averages: The 7-day moving average (MA) is below the 21-day MA.   3. 200-day Moving Average is above the Price.   5. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is < than 50.   6. Price Target:35   Monster Beverage Corporation is an American beverage company that produces energy drinks, soft drinks, and natural beverages. As of my last update in January 2022, heres a brief overview:   1. History   Monster Beverage Corporation was originally a natural beverage company called Hansen's, which was founded in 1935. They sold fruit juices, sodas, and other natural beverages for many years. In 2002, the company introduced the Monster Energy drink, which became extremely popular and led to a major shift in the company's focus towards energy drinks. In 2012, the company changed its name from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation to better reflect its primary product.   2. Products   Monster's most popular product line is its range of energy drinks, which include:   - Monster Energy (Original)   - Monster Ultra (Zero-calorie versions)   - Java Monster (Coffee-flavored)   - Monster Rehab (Tea-based)   - Hydro Monster (Non-carbonated, electrolyte beverage)   ...and many other variants.   The company has also ventured into other drink categories and has collaborations with other brands and celebrities.   3. Acquisition by Coca-Cola   In 2015, The Coca-Cola Company and Monster Beverage Corporation announced a partnership where Coca-Cola transferred its energy drink business to Monster, and Monster transferred its non-energy drink business to Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola also acquired a significant minority stake in Monster as a part of this deal. This partnership helped Monster expand its global distribution significantly, as it could now leverage Coca-Cola's expansive distribution network.   4. Controversies:   Like many energy drink companies, Monster has faced criticism and legal challenges related to the health effects and marketing of its products, especially towards young consumers.   5. Financials and Stock Market Performance:   Monster Beverage Corporation is a publicly-traded company, and its stock performance and financials can be found on financial platforms or its official investor relations website.   Two key figures in the company's history are:   1. Rodney C. Sacks: He has been the Chairman and CEO of Monster Beverage Corporation for several decades. Sacks, along with Hilton Schlosberg, acquired Hansen's Natural (the predecessor to Monster Beverage Corporation) in 1992. Under their leadership, the company transitioned from selling natural sodas to launching the Monster Energy drink in 2002, which ultimately led to substantial growth.   2. Hilton Schlosberg: He has been the Vice Chairman, President, COO, and CFO of the company. Like Sacks, Schlosberg played an integral role in the transformation and success of Monster Beverage Corporation.   Both Sacks and Schlosberg have been instrumental in guiding the company's strategy, growth, and expansion over the years.   Rodney C. Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, the key figures behind Monster Beverage Corporation's rise, both originally come from South Africa. They migrated to the United States, where they eventually took over Hansen's Natural and transformed it into the energy drink giant known as Monster Beverage Corporation. Their South African background and their success in the American beverage industry make their story quite notable in the world of business."

V-Shape Correction:   A standout feature in the recent price movement is the V-shape correction. This formation often indicates a sharp reversal in trend. After a swift drop, the price has recovered with equivalent vigour, suggesting a possible change in sentiment among traders and investors.   2. 200-Day Moving Average:   The stock has had significant interactions with the 200-day moving average, a vital indicator for gauging long-term trends. Currently, the price is below this average, which could act as a resistance level in the immediate term.   3. Fibonacci Retracement Levels:   Currently, the stock is oscillating near the 50.0% retracement level. The area around the 61.8% retracement is marked as ""increase exposure around 41.00,"" indicating that this could be a strategic level to monitor for trade entries or adjustments.   4. Target and Stop Levels:   A bullish target is set at $42.00, presenting a potential upside of +5.4%. On the flip side, a stop is suggested at $39.00, indicating a potential risk of -2.1%. With a win/loss ratio of 2.8:1, the potential reward outweighs the potential risk by nearly threefold, presenting a favourable scenario for those with a bullish outlook.   Conclusion:   Exelon Corporation's chart paints a picture of recovery following a sharp decline. The V-shape correction, combined with interactions at key Fibonacci levels, suggests potential opportunities for traders. However, the 200-day moving average might act as a near-term resistance."

This etf has been on a bearish trend since Mar 2020 and I would label this trend as an impulsive wave.  As depicted in my chart, TLT is now on the path of wave v  of a third wave extension, with a target price of 68. This target price is equivalent to a 2.618 extension of wave 1.  Upon reaching this target price, a reversal will bring the etf to a target price of 108 as wave 4, a 0.382 retracement of wave 3. Most likely wave 4 will be a triangle or zigzag before heading finally down to region of 70 to 59, thereby completing the impulsive 5 wave pattern."

The property market has been causing much unhappiness among the people of China despite the government announcing measures to prop it up (interest rates cut, lower downpayment,etc) Still, the people are hesitant and everyone is sitting on the fence hoping for more and better incentives from the government.   From the weekly chart, we can see multiple support at 81.58 price level , beginning from March 2022. It has been going sideways for more than 18 months without giving its investors much hope of a rally. But now, we are again near the end of the bearish trend and there lies a possibility of yet another breakthrough. Or, it could revisit the next support at the 56.66 price level.

This is a Technical Analysis Update on Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) on the 1 Week Timeframe.   URNM was able to BREAK Above the 2 year Resistance line and close Friday with a Strong body candle close.   It was accompanied with a VOLUME SPIKE, which shows follow through and supports price action.   This is the 1st step in attempting a Trend Change.   2nd MOST important step = Confirming the breakout = Testing Support and Succeeding   So this upcoming Week to couple weeks is crucial for us to stay above Resistance line.   Not only are we ABOVE the Resistance line but we also CLOSED ABOVE the 100 SMA. Again if we confirm SUPPORT, we will now have the backing of 2 MAJOR Resistance turned SUPPORT zones.   Prior to this current move we also maintained SUPPORT on the 50 SMA for 3 weeks before moving up.   In the coming weeks, it is likely we also have a GOLDEN CROSS occur.   This is when the 50 SMA CROSSES ABOVE the 100 SMA. This leads to a confirmation of BULL TREND. So i'd we watching for this.   Bullish Momentum is also currently PRESENT, expressed through the STOCH RSI and MACD.   One thing to OBSERVE aggressively is the MACD.   Particularly on the size of the histogram bars and the slope of the blue/orange line. We are ABOVE the 0 level, universally this leads to BULLISH MOMENTUM and UPTRENDS.   ________________________________________________________________________________   Thank you for taking the time to read my analysis.
